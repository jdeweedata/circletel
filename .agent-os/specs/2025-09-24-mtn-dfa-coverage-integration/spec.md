# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: MTN DFA Coverage Integration
> Created: 2025-09-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance CircleTel's existing coverage checking system by integrating MTN's live WMS coverage maps and DFA's ArcGIS-based fibre infrastructure data to provide comprehensive multi-provider coverage analysis for both consumer and business users. This integration will build upon the current interactive coverage checker to deliver real-time, accurate coverage data across multiple providers.

## User Stories

### Consumer Instant Coverage Check
As a potential consumer customer, I want to check fibre and mobile coverage at my home address with instant visual results, so that I can quickly determine which internet services are available without waiting for manual verification.

**Detailed Workflow:** User enters address in enhanced search box → System performs parallel queries to MTN WMS layers and DFA ArcGIS services → Display interactive map with color-coded coverage overlays → Show available packages with real-time pricing → Provide "Sign Up Now" path for covered services.

### Business Multi-Site Coverage Analysis
As a business customer, I want to check coverage across multiple office locations with detailed feasibility reports and SLA options, so that I can make informed decisions about connectivity solutions and request custom enterprise quotes.

**Detailed Workflow:** User enters multiple business addresses → System performs batch coverage analysis with parallel API calls → Generate comprehensive feasibility report with coverage maps → Display SLA options (99.5%, 99.9%) and estimated costs → Export professional PDF report → Connect with sales team for custom quotes.

### Enhanced Provider Comparison
As any user, I want to see real-time coverage data from different providers overlaid on an interactive map with clear visual distinctions, so that I can compare options and understand coverage quality in my area.

**Detailed Workflow:** User views enhanced coverage map → System displays WMS overlay layers for MTN mobile and DFA fibre → Click coverage areas for detailed provider information → Side-by-side comparison with signal strength and technology details → Filter by technology type (4G/5G/Fibre).

## Spec Scope

1. **MTN WMS Coverage Integration** - Integrate MTN's live coverage map WMS API for 4G/5G mobile broadband coverage with real-time signal strength data
2. **Enhanced DFA ArcGIS Integration** - Upgrade existing DFA integration with full ArcGIS REST API capabilities for connected buildings and fibre infrastructure
3. **Interactive Coverage Visualization** - Enhanced coverage map component with WMS layer support and provider-specific overlays
4. **Business Workflow Enhancement** - Separate user experiences for consumer vs business customers with multi-site analysis and SLA options
5. **Performance & Caching System** - Multi-tier caching with PostGIS spatial indexing and rate limiting for external API stability

## Out of Scope

- Real-time network speed testing or performance monitoring
- Automatic service provisioning or inventory management
- Integration with billing systems or payment processing
- Advanced network topology visualization beyond coverage areas
- Third-party provider integrations beyond MTN and DFA

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced coverage checking interface with MTN WMS integration and improved DFA capabilities working in production environment
2. Interactive coverage maps displaying multi-provider data with color-coded availability indicators and technology-specific overlays
3. Differentiated user flows for consumer (single address, instant results) and business (multi-site, detailed reports) customers with appropriate feature sets
