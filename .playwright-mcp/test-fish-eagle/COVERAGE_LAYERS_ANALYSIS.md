## WMS Coverage Layer Technical Details

### How Coverage Layers Work

**WMS (Web Map Service):**
- GeoServer-based mapping service
- Serves geographic data as visual map tiles
- Each technology type has dedicated layer(s)
- Tiles rendered in EPSG:900913 (Web Mercator) projection

**Layer Request Pattern:**
```
https://mtnsi.mtn.co.za/geoserver/mtnsi/wms?
  SERVICE=WMS
  &REQUEST=GetMap
  &LAYERS=mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-ALL2  (varies by technology)
  &BBOX=[coordinates]
  &WIDTH=256
  &HEIGHT=256
  &FORMAT=image/png
  &TRANSPARENT=true
```

**Coverage Interpretation:**
- Colors indicate **potential service availability**
- Visual coverage ‚â† guaranteed installation
- Actual feasibility requires API verification (currently failing)
- Darker/more saturated colors typically indicate stronger coverage

### Color Coding System

| Color | Technology | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| üü• Red/Pink | Fixed LTE | Extensive cellular-based coverage |
| üü¶ Blue | Licensed Wireless | Radio frequency coverage (LOS dependent) |
| üü© Green | Fibre | Physical cable infrastructure zones |
| üü¶ Teal/Cyan | Uncapped Wireless | Cellular data coverage |
| üü® Yellow-Green | All Technologies | Composite availability |

## Insights for CircleTel Integration

### Key Learnings

1. **Visual Coverage Layers are Reliable**
   - WMS layers loaded successfully even when Feasibility API failed
   - Provide valuable fallback for coverage indication
   - Can guide technology recommendations

2. **Color-Based Technology Identification**
   - Each technology has distinct visual signature
   - Enables quick at-a-glance coverage assessment
   - Useful for customer-facing coverage maps

3. **Coverage ‚â† Guaranteed Service**
   - Visual coverage shows potential, not certainty
   - Feasibility API (when working) provides actual availability
   - Line-of-sight and infrastructure validation still required

### Integration Recommendations

**For CircleTel Coverage Checker:**

1. **Implement WMS Layer Queries**
   ```typescript
   // Alternative to failed Feasibility API
   async function checkCoverageViaWMS(lat: number, lng: number) {
     const technologies = ['fibre', 'fixedlte', 'wireless', 'licensed'];
     const results = {};

     for (const tech of technologies) {
       const coverage = await queryWMSLayer(tech, lat, lng);
       results[tech] = coverage.available;
     }

     return results;
   }
   ```

2. **Visual Coverage Map Component**
   - Display color-coded coverage layers
   - Allow users to toggle technology types
   - Show legend explaining colors
   - Add disclaimer about visual vs. actual availability

3. **Fallback Strategy**
   ```typescript
   // Try Feasibility API first, fall back to WMS
   try {
     const result = await checkFeasibilityAPI(address);
     return result;
   } catch (error) {
     console.warn('Feasibility API failed, using WMS fallback');
     return await checkCoverageViaWMS(lat, lng);
   }
   ```

4. **Coverage Confidence Scoring**
   ```typescript
   interface CoverageConfidence {
     technology: string;
     visual_coverage: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'limited' | 'none';
     confidence: number; // 0-100%
     source: 'feasibility_api' | 'wms_visual' | 'estimated';
   }
   ```

## Technical Implementation Details

### WMS GetFeatureInfo Query (Alternative to Feasibility API)

Instead of relying on the broken Feasibility API, CircleTel can query WMS layers directly:

```javascript
// Get coverage data at specific coordinates
const url = `https://mtnsi.mtn.co.za/geoserver/mtnsi/wms?
  SERVICE=WMS
  &VERSION=1.1.1
  &REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo
  &LAYERS=mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-FIBRE,mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-LTE,mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-WIRELESS
  &QUERY_LAYERS=mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-FIBRE,mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-LTE,mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-WIRELESS
  &INFO_FORMAT=application/json
  &FEATURE_COUNT=50
  &X=128
  &Y=128
  &SRS=EPSG:4326
  &WIDTH=256
  &HEIGHT=256
  &BBOX=${lng-0.001},${lat-0.001},${lng+0.001},${lat+0.001}`;

const response = await fetch(url);
const data = await response.json();

// Parse coverage from response
const coverage = {
  fibre: data.features.some(f => f.properties.FIBRE_AVAILABLE),
  fixedLTE: data.features.some(f => f.properties.LTE_AVAILABLE),
  wireless: data.features.some(f => f.properties.WIRELESS_AVAILABLE)
};
```

### Coverage Layer Names (Inferred)

Based on observed behavior:

- `mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-ALL2` - All technologies composite
- `mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-FIBRE` - Fibre coverage (likely)
- `mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-LTE` or `MTN-EBU-RBUS-FIXED-LTE` - Fixed LTE
- `mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-WIRELESS` - Uncapped wireless
- `mtnsi:MTN-EBU-RBUS-LICENSED` - Licensed wireless

**Note:** Exact layer names need verification via GetCapabilities request:
```
https://mtnsi.mtn.co.za/geoserver/mtnsi/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities
```

## Comparison: Visual vs. API-Based Coverage

| Aspect | WMS Visual Layers | Feasibility API (when working) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Availability** | ‚úÖ Reliable | ‚ùå Currently failing (502) |
| **Data Type** | Visual/geographic zones | Precise address-based data |
| **Accuracy** | Approximate/indicative | Exact service availability |
| **Speed** | Fast (tile-based) | Slower (database query) |
| **Detail Level** | Coverage zones only | Speeds, packages, pricing |
| **Use Case** | Initial screening | Final verification |
| **Reliability** | High (GeoServer stable) | Low (proxy issues) |

**Recommendation:** Use WMS as **primary coverage indicator** with Feasibility API as **confirmation step** (when available).

// Tier 1: Visual WMS Check (fast, always available)
const visualCoverage = await checkWMSCoverage(coordinates);

// Tier 2: Feasibility API (detailed, sometimes unavailable)
try {
  const apiCoverage = await checkFeasibilityAPI(address);
  return { ...visualCoverage, ...apiCoverage, source: 'api' };
} catch {
  return { ...visualCoverage, source: 'wms_visual_only',
           disclaimer: 'Showing visual coverage only. Contact for confirmation.' };
}

// Tier 3: Manual Verification (when needed)
if (visualCoverage.uncertain) {
  suggestManualVerification(address);
}
```
