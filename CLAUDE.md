- **Multi-browser Testing** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari across desktop, mobile, tablet
- **Visual Baselines** - Automated screenshot comparison with threshold tolerance

### CI/CD Pipeline Optimization âš¡ VERIFIED WORKING
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Husky runs `npm run validate` before each commit (prevents broken pushes)
- **Smart CI Strategy** - Parallel jobs with conditional test execution
  - **validate & build**: Always run in parallel (~30s - 2min) âœ…
  - **test**: Only runs on PRs or when commit message contains `[run-tests]` âœ…
- **Local-first Validation** - Most validation happens locally to save CI time
- **Verified Performance Results**:
  - Local validation: ~5 seconds (changed files only) âœ…
  - Regular CI runs: ~30 seconds - 2 minutes (validate + build only) âœ…
  - Full CI with tests: ~7-8 minutes (only when needed) âœ…

**CRITICAL: DO NOT change the CI conditional logic in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**
- The test job conditional `if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' || contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[run-tests]') }}` is working correctly
- Regular commits should only run 2 jobs (validate + build), test job should show as skipped âŠ˜

## Key Integration Points

### Supabase Edge Functions
When working with backend functionality:
- Edge Functions are deployed via Supabase CLI: `supabase functions deploy <function-name>`
- Test locally with `supabase functions serve`
- Function logs available via Supabase dashboard or CLI
- CORS headers configured in `_shared/cors.ts`

### Form Development Patterns
When creating new forms:
1. Create form schema with Zod in dedicated `types.ts` file
2. Use form persistence hooks for auto-save functionality
3. Implement progress calculation for multi-step forms
4. Add validation utilities from `src/components/forms/utils/`
5. Submit to corresponding Supabase Edge Function

### Admin Feature Development
- All admin routes require authentication via `useAdminAuth` hook
- Use real-time sync for live data updates in admin interfaces
- Follow approval workflow patterns for business process automation
- Admin components should use design system tokens and patterns

### Admin Documentation System
When working with admin documentation:
- **Documentation Pages** - Located in `src/pages/admin/docs/` with markdown content and interactive examples
- **Layout Component** - `AdminDocsLayout.tsx` provides sidebar navigation, search, and responsive design
- **Code Playground** - `CodePlayground.tsx` enables interactive code examples with execution simulation
- **Markdown Rendering** - Uses `react-markdown` with custom components from `src/lib/markdown.ts`
- **Search Functionality** - Powered by Fuse.js for fuzzy search across documentation content
- **Route Structure** - All documentation routes nested under `/admin/docs/*` with automatic redirect to overview

### Client-Specific Implementations
- Client forms organized by client name (e.g., `unjani/`)
- Each client has dedicated types, validation, and components
- Priority calculation algorithms for business logic
- Integration with backend systems for data processing

### Development Notes
- **Path Aliases**: `@/` maps to `src/`
- **Lovable Platform** - Managed through lovable.dev with automatic git integration
- **Environment Variables** - Configured in `.env` for API keys and Supabase connection
- **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Full type safety with React Hook Form integration
- **Git Hooks** - Pre-commit validation automatically runs (use `npm run prepare` to reinstall if needed)

## Documentation Management ðŸ“š

### Local Documentation Structure
**Location**: `docs/` (excluded from Git repository)
**Status**: Clean and organized structure implemented

#### Documentation Categories (7 logical folders)
- `products/` - Product portfolio and specifications (10+ active products)
- `business-requirements/` - BRS v2.0 and MVP strategy documents
- `technical/` - Design system, coverage enhancement, email infrastructure
- `deployment/` - Operations guides and environment configuration
- `integrations/` - Zoho CRM, Supabase, third-party API integration guides
- `analysis/` - Performance reports, user journey analysis, coverage optimization
- `archive/` - Historical documents and legacy versions

#### Git Configuration
```gitignore
# Documentation folder - Product docs and business requirements
/docs/
```
**Rationale**: Business documentation contains sensitive product specifications, pricing, and strategy information that should remain local only. Git exclusion prevents accidental exposure while maintaining team access to technical documentation.

#### Master Documentation Index
- `docs/README.md` - Complete documentation navigator with quick access links
- **25+ organized documents** across 7 categories for easy maintenance
- **Cross-references** to Agent OS roadmap and product integration status
- **Version control** for business requirements with archive policy

## Development Workflow Best Practices

### Daily Development
1. **Before coding**: Run `npm run validate` to check current state
2. **During development**: Auto-save runs local validation via pre-commit hooks
3. **Before pushing**: Major changes should run `npm run validate:full`
4. **For releases**: Always run `npm run validate:all` to include full test suite

### CI Optimization Guidelines âš¡ PROVEN EFFECTIVE
- **Regular commits**: Let CI run fast validation only (~30s-2min) âœ… VERIFIED
- **When tests needed**: Add `[run-tests]` to commit message (will run ~7min)
- **Pull requests**: Tests run automatically (full validation)
- **Emergency fixes**: Use `git commit --no-verify` to skip pre-commit (not recommended)

**Examples of correct usage:**
```bash
# Fast CI (30s-2min) - for regular development
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git commit -m "Fix bug in payment processing"
git commit -m "Update documentation"

# Full CI with tests (~7min) - when you need comprehensive validation
git commit -m "Add payment integration [run-tests]"
git commit -m "Major refactor of authentication [run-tests]"
```

### Performance Monitoring âœ… CURRENT BENCHMARKS
- **Local validation**: ~5 seconds (ACHIEVED âœ…)
- **CI validate/build**: ~30s-2min (ACHIEVED âœ…)
- **Full test suite**: ~7-8 minutes (ACHIEVED âœ…)
- **Alert thresholds**: If CI exceeds 3min without tests, investigate immediately

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Regular commits taking longer than 3 minutes
- Test job running when it shouldn't (check for âŠ˜ skipped symbol)
- Pre-commit hooks taking longer than 10 seconds
- Any workflow taking longer than 10 minutes total

### Code Quality Standards
- **Zero TypeScript errors**: Required for all commits
- **ESLint compliance**: Auto-fixable issues should be resolved automatically
- **Build success**: All commits must build successfully
- **Test coverage**: New features should include appropriate tests

## âš¡ Future Development: Maintaining CI Performance

### When Adding New Features
**ALWAYS follow this pattern for optimal CI performance:**

1. **Feature Development Commits** (Regular pace - 30s CI):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add user profile component"
   git commit -m "Implement email validation"
   git commit -m "Update API endpoints"
   ```

2. **Major Feature Completion** (Full validation - 7min CI):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Complete user authentication system [run-tests]"
   ```

3. **Pull Requests** (Automatic full validation):
   - Tests run automatically on all PRs
   - No need to add `[run-tests]` to PR commits

### CI Troubleshooting for Future Developers
If CI is running slow again:

1. **Check workflow run** - Should see only 2 jobs (validate âœ…, build âœ…, test âŠ˜)
2. **If test job runs unexpectedly**:
   - Check commit message doesn't accidentally contain `[run-tests]`
   - Verify the conditional in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` hasn't been modified
3. **If CI exceeds 3 minutes regularly**:
   - Review and optimize the validation scripts in `scripts/`
   - Consider adding more files to smart validation exclusions

### Protected CI Configuration
**DO NOT MODIFY** these critical files without careful consideration:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Optimized conditional logic
- `scripts/validate-changed.js` - Smart validation script
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook configuration
- `package.json` validation scripts

## Current Development: Interactive Coverage Checker

### Active Feature (003-interactive-coverage-checker)
