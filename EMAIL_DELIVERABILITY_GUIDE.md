# 📧 Email Deliverability Improvement Guide

## 🎯 Current Status: NORMAL for New Domains

Your email ending up in the junk folder is **completely expected** for a new domain. This is actually a good sign - it means:

✅ **Email was delivered** (not bounced)
✅ **Domain verification works**
✅ **API integration is successful**
✅ **DNS records are properly configured**

## 🚀 Reputation Building Strategy

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- **Start Small**: Send 10-20 emails per day maximum
- **Real Recipients**: Only send to legitimate business contacts
- **Quality Content**: Professional, relevant emails only
- **Monitor Bounces**: Keep bounce rate under 2%

### Week 3-4: Growth
- **Increase Volume**: Gradually increase to 50-100 emails per day
- **Engagement**: Encourage recipients to reply or click links
- **Consistency**: Send regularly, not in bursts

### Month 2+: Established
- **Normal Volume**: Send as needed (100-500+ emails per day)
- **Inbox Placement**: Should improve significantly
- **Domain Reputation**: Established as legitimate sender

## 📋 Immediate Actions for Better Deliverability

### 1. Optimize Email Content
```html
<!-- Add these elements to improve deliverability -->
<p style="font-size: 12px; color: #666;">
  This email was sent by CircleTel regarding your Unjani audit submission.
  If you did not request this, please contact us at unjani@notifications.circletelsa.co.za
</p>
```

### 2. Recipients Should:
- **Mark as "Not Junk"** when they receive emails
- **Add to contacts**: `noreply@notifications.circletelsa.co.za`
- **Reply when appropriate** (increases engagement score)

### 3. Monitor Email Health
```bash
# Check your domain reputation (periodically)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer re_6iZ9mzS5_F4mjSkQYHyYP6teateSeknUV" \
  https://api.resend.com/domains/notifications.circletelsa.co.za
```

## ⚡ Quick Wins for Inbox Placement

### Update Email Templates
1. **Add Physical Address** (builds trust):
   ```
   CircleTel (Pty) Ltd
   [Your Business Address]
   South Africa
   ```

2. **Include Unsubscribe Link** (even for transactional emails):
   ```html
   <p><a href="mailto:unjani@notifications.circletelsa.co.za?subject=Unsubscribe">
     Unsubscribe from audit notifications
   </a></p>
   ```

3. **Add Text Version** (already done ✅)

### Warm-up Strategy
1. **Week 1**: Send test emails to your own email accounts
2. **Week 2**: Send to team members and mark as "Not Junk"
3. **Week 3**: Start sending to real clinic contacts
4. **Week 4+**: Normal operation

## 📊 Expected Timeline

| Timeframe | Inbox Rate | Actions |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Day 1-7** | 20-40% | Manual "Not Junk" marking needed |
| **Week 2-3** | 50-70% | Some improvement, continue warm-up |
| **Month 2** | 80-90% | Most emails reach inbox |
| **Month 3+** | 95%+ | Excellent reputation established |

## 🔧 Advanced Deliverability Settings

### SPF Record Enhancement
```dns
TXT @ "v=spf1 include:resend.com include:_spf.google.com ~all"
```

### DMARC Policy (Optional)
```dns
TXT _dmarc "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@circletelsa.co.za"
```

### Feedback Loops
- Monitor spam complaints
- Set up dedicated email for abuse reports
- Respond quickly to delivery issues

## 🎯 Unjani-Specific Recommendations

### For Clinic Notifications:
1. **Pre-announce**: Tell clinics to expect emails from your domain
2. **Clear Subject Lines**: Use consistent, professional subjects
3. **Business Hours**: Send during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
4. **Follow-up**: Call clinics to confirm they received emails

### Content Optimization:
```javascript
// Update email subjects for better recognition
const subject = `🏥 CircleTel: Your Unjani Audit Confirmation - ${clinicName}`;
// Instead of: 🏥 Test: Unjani Audit Notification System
```

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't use spam trigger words** (FREE, URGENT, etc.)
❌ **Don't send from multiple domains** (stick to one)
