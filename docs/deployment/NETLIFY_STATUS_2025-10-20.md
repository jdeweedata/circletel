# Netlify Deployment Status - 2025-10-20

**Date**: 2025-10-20 13:00 UTC
**Project ID**: `af81b4b6-db92-4c6f-a838-aa0b06c07d3c`
**Site Name**: `circletel`

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Configuration Complete
- ✅ Netlify project linked to local repository
- ✅ 50 environment variables added successfully
- ✅ `netlify.toml` configuration file in place
- ✅ `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` installed and configured

### ⚠️ CLI Deployment Issue
**Problem**: `netlify deploy --prod` from Windows failed during "publishing static content" phase

**Error**:
```
Error: Failed publishing static content
Plugin "@netlify/plugin-nextjs" failed in "onPostBuild" event
```

**Root Cause**: CLI deployment from local Windows environment conflicts with Netlify's build system. Netlify expects builds to run on their servers, not locally.

---

## Solution: Git-Based Deployment

Netlify automatically deploys when code is pushed to the connected Git repository.

### Setup Steps:

1. **Connect GitHub Repository** (via Netlify Dashboard)
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/circletel/settings/deploys
   - Connect to: `jdeweedata/circletel-nextjs`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Build command: `npm run build` (already in `netlify.toml`)
   - Publish directory: `.next` (already in `netlify.toml`)

2. **Trigger Deployment**
   - Push any commit to `main` branch
   - Netlify will automatically:
     - Clone repository
     - Install dependencies
     - Run `npm run build`
     - Deploy to CDN

## Next Steps

1. Go to Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/sites/circletel/
2. Navigate to: Site settings → Build & deploy → Continuous deployment
3. Click "Link repository"
4. Select: GitHub → `jdeweedata/circletel-nextjs` → Branch: `main`
5. Netlify will automatically deploy on next Git push

### Option B: Manual Trigger
Once GitHub is connected, push a commit:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger: Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Deployment Time

- **GitHub clone**: ~10 seconds
- **npm install**: ~2 minutes
- **npm run build**: ~2 minutes
- **Deploy to CDN**: ~30 seconds
- **Total**: ~5 minutes

## Verification Checklist

After successful deployment:

- [ ] Visit site URL: `https://circletel.netlify.app`
- [ ] Test homepage loads
- [ ] Test coverage checker with address: "18 Rasmus Erasmus, Heritage Hill, Centurion"
- [ ] Verify packages page shows 14+ packages (confirming bug fixes work)
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify Supabase authentication works

## Alternative: Vercel Status

**Vercel IAD1 Outage**: Still ongoing as of 2025-10-20 13:00 UTC
- Started: 08:03 UTC
- Impact: All deployments failing
- Status page: https://www.vercel-status.com/

**Our Supabase key fixes are ready** - once Vercel recovers OR Netlify GitHub integration is set up, deployment will succeed with all bug fixes included.
