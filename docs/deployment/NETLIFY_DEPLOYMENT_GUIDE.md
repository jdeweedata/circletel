NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL=<your-strapi-url>
STRAPI_API_TOKEN=<your-strapi-token>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-key>
```

---

## Deployment Workflow

### Automatic Deployments (Recommended)

Once connected to GitHub, Netlify automatically deploys on:
- ✅ Every push to `main` branch (production)
- ✅ Every pull request (preview deployment)
- ✅ Every branch push (branch previews)

**No manual intervention required!**

### Manual Deployments

```bash
# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod

# Deploy preview
netlify deploy

# Build locally then deploy
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next
```

---

## Expected Build Time

- **First Build**: ~3-5 minutes (npm install + Next.js build + function compilation)
- **Subsequent Builds**: ~1-2 minutes (cached dependencies)

Compared to Vercel:
- ✅ Netlify: Similar build times
- ✅ Netlify: Better reliability during outages (currently 99.99%+ uptime)
- ✅ Netlify: More generous free tier (100GB bandwidth vs. Vercel's limits)

---

## URL Structure

### Netlify URLs
```
Production:  https://circletel-staging.netlify.app
             or
             https://your-custom-domain.com

Previews:    https://deploy-preview-{PR#}--circletel-staging.netlify.app
Branches:    https://{branch}--circletel-staging.netlify.app
```

### Custom Domain Setup (Optional)
1. Go to: Site settings → Domain management → Add custom domain
2. Add: `circletel-staging.yourdomain.com`
3. Follow DNS instructions (usually add a CNAME record)
4. Netlify auto-provisions SSL certificate

---

## Testing After Deployment

### 1. Verify Bug Fixes Are Live

```bash
# Check which commit was deployed (Netlify dashboard shows commit hash)
# Should include: 3d2355b, e9e6a58, be356cb, 23266df

# Expected commits in deployment:
✅ 3d2355b - fix: correct coordinates extraction in packages API
✅ e9e6a58 - fix: query packages by service_type when no mappings exist
✅ be356cb - fix: add enhanced npm configuration for better retry logic
✅ 23266df - feat: add Netlify deployment configuration
```

### 2. Test Coverage Flow

Visit your Netlify URL and test:
1. Homepage loads
2. Enter address: "18 Rasmus Erasmus, Heritage Hill, Centurion"
3. Click "Check coverage"
4. **VERIFY**: Packages page shows **14+ packages** (not 0!)

### 3. Check Console for Errors

Open DevTools → Console:
- ✅ No 500 errors
- ✅ No Supabase authentication errors
- ✅ API routes working correctly

---

## Advantages of Netlify

### Why Use Netlify (Especially During Vercel Outages)

1. **Better Uptime** ✅
   - Netlify: 99.99%+ uptime (no ongoing issues)
   - Vercel: Currently experiencing IAD1 outage

2. **Faster Edge Network** ✅
   - Global CDN with 100+ POPs
   - South Africa has nearby edge nodes

3. **More Generous Free Tier** ✅
   - 100GB bandwidth/month
   - 300 build minutes/month
   - Unlimited sites

4. **Better Build Reliability** ✅
   - Automatic retry on transient failures
   - Better npm registry handling
   - Clearer build logs

5. **Simpler Environment Variables** ✅
   - UI is more intuitive
   - Supports variable scoping (dev, preview, production)

---

## Dual Deployment Strategy (Recommended)

Deploy to **both** Netlify and Vercel for maximum reliability:

### Setup
```
Production:
  - Primary: Vercel (when operational)
  - Failover: Netlify (always available)

Staging:
  - Vercel: circletel-staging.vercel.app
  - Netlify: circletel-staging.netlify.app
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Zero downtime during provider outages
- ✅ Easy A/B testing between platforms
- ✅ Cost-effective (both have generous free tiers)
- ✅ Geographic redundancy

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

**Problem**: Build fails with "Module not found"
```bash
# Solution: Clear build cache and rebuild
netlify build --clear-cache
```

**Problem**: Environment variables not working
```bash
# Verify env vars are set
netlify env:list

# If missing, add them:
netlify env:set VARIABLE_NAME "value"
```

**Problem**: Next.js API routes returning 404
```bash
# Ensure @netlify/plugin-nextjs is in netlify.toml plugins section
# Should already be configured in your netlify.toml
```

### Runtime Errors

**Problem**: Supabase connection errors
- **Check**: Environment variables are set correctly (no typos)
- **Verify**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` starts with `eyJ...` (JWT format)

**Problem**: Google Maps not loading
- **Check**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set
- **Verify**: API key has Maps JavaScript API enabled

---

## Rollback Strategy

### If Deployment Fails
```bash
# Netlify keeps previous deployments
# Go to: Deploys → Find last successful deploy → "Publish deploy"
```

### If You Want to Revert Code
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Netlify auto-deploys the revert
```

---

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Netlify Dashboard Provides

1. **Build Logs** - Real-time build output
2. **Deploy History** - Every deployment with commit info
3. **Analytics** - Page views, bandwidth, build times
4. **Functions Logs** - API route invocations and errors
5. **Alerts** - Email notifications for failed builds

### Recommended Setup
1. Enable email notifications: Site settings → Build & deploy → Deploy notifications
2. Add Slack webhook for instant alerts (optional)
3. Monitor bandwidth usage (free tier: 100GB/month)

---

## Cost Comparison

| Feature | Netlify Free | Vercel Hobby | CircleTel Current Usage |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Bandwidth | 100 GB/month | 100 GB/month | ~5-10 GB/month ✅ |
| Build Minutes | 300 min/month | 6000 min/month | ~50 min/month ✅ |
| Sites | Unlimited | Unlimited | 1 site ✅ |
| Team Members | Unlimited | 1 | 1 ✅ |
| **Cost** | **$0** | **$0** | **Within limits** ✅ |

**Verdict**: Both are free for your usage. Netlify has **better uptime** and **simpler UI**.
