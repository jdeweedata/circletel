## Why NOT Mail-0/Zero for Business

### Technical Complexity:
- Requires self-hosting expertise
- Need to maintain server infrastructure
- Custom development for Outlook integration

### Business Risk:
- Open-source project dependency

### Overkill for Needs:

## Implementation for Your Notification System

### Immediate Steps:

1. **GoDaddy Email Forwarding:**
   ```bash
   # Set up these forwards in GoDaddy:
   unjani@circletelsa.co.za → your-current-outlook@email.com
   unjani-team@circletelsa.co.za → your-current-outlook@email.com
   rollout@circletelsa.co.za → your-current-outlook@email.com
   noreply@circletelsa.co.za → your-current-outlook@email.com
   ```

2. **Resend Domain Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Add these DNS records in GoDaddy:
   TXT @ "resend-verification=..."
   CNAME resend._domainkey "resend._domainkey.resend.com"
   TXT @ "v=spf1 include:resend.com ~all"
   ```

3. **Update Our System:**
   ```typescript
   // Already configured in our .env.local:
   CIRCLETEL_DOMAIN=circletelsa.co.za
   UNJANI_TEAM_EMAILS=unjani-team@circletelsa.co.za,rollout@circletelsa.co.za
   UNJANI_SUPPORT_EMAIL=unjani@circletelsa.co.za
   ```

### Testing Plan:
1. Submit test audit through our form
2. Verify team notifications arrive in your Outlook

4. Check email deliverability and formatting
