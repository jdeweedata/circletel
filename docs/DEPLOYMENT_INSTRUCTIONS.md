### What Needs Deployment:

- 🔄 **Environment Variables**: Need to be set in Supabase dashboard

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Edge Functions

Since the project is currently in read-only mode, you'll need to deploy the Edge Functions manually via the Supabase Dashboard:

#### A. Deploy `send-audit-notification` Function

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Navigate to**: Your Project → Edge Functions
3. **Create New Function**: Click "Create Function"
4. **Function Name**: `send-audit-notification`
5. **Copy the code** from: `supabase/functions/send-audit-notification/index.ts`

#### B. Deploy `unjani-form-submission` Function

1. **Create New Function**: `unjani-form-submission`
2. **Copy the code** from: `supabase/functions/unjani-form-submission/index.ts`

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

In your Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Edge Functions → Environment Variables:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_6iZ9mzS5_F4mjSkQYHyYP6teateSeknUV
CIRCLETEL_DOMAIN=notifications.circletelsa.co.za
UNJANI_TEAM_EMAILS=unjani-team@notifications.circletelsa.co.za,rollout@notifications.circletelsa.co.za
UNJANI_SUPPORT_EMAIL=unjani@notifications.circletelsa.co.za
UNJANI_SUPPORT_PHONE=087 150 8000
```

### Step 3: Test the Complete Flow

1. **Go to your website**: http://localhost:8080
2. **Navigate to**: Unjani Contract Audit Form
3. **Fill out the form** with test data
4. **Configure notifications**:
   - ✅ Notify Team (default: on)
   - ✅ Notify Client (default: on)
   - 📧 Custom emails: Add any additional recipients
5. **Submit the form**
6. **Check your email** for notifications

## 🔧 Alternative CLI Deployment (When Available)

```bash
# Set the new API key as environment variable
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_0c5aeee8d0b800b0a6dacf4d4e23678a92e4282d

# Deploy functions
supabase functions deploy send-audit-notification
supabase functions deploy unjani-form-submission

# Set environment variables
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_6iZ9mzS5_F4mjSkQYHyYP6teateSeknUV
supabase secrets set CIRCLETEL_DOMAIN=notifications.circletelsa.co.za
supabase secrets set UNJANI_TEAM_EMAILS=unjani-team@notifications.circletelsa.co.za,rollout@notifications.circletelsa.co.za
```
