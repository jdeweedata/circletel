## **1. Founding Story: The Hardware Store Owner Turned Tech CEO**

### **Douglas Reed - The Unconventional Entrepreneur**

**The Unusual Background (1975-1997)**

Douglas Reed's journey to becoming a telecom titan is perhaps the most unorthodox in South African ISP history:

- **Age 20**: Completed first year of BCom, then worked on **North Sea oil rig**
- **Age 22**: Returned to South Africa, took over **Sandton City Hardware**
- **Next 16 years**: Built career in **DIY hardware** - tools, equipment, and home improvement
- **Career roles**: Managing Director of **Mica Distributors**, Board Member of Mica Hardware Group
- **Late 30s realization**: "I was wasting time working for other people"

**The Career Pivot (1997)**

- **Age 38**: Received offer from Control Instruments to head **DataPro**, its IT support division
- **Initial status**: Small company turning over **R150,000 per month** (roughly R630,000 in 2025 money)
- **Bold move**: Took a **salary cut** and bought **30% of the business**
- **Vision**: Transform it into a national Internet service provider

**Reed's Philosophy:**
> "I took over a company that had no business plan in place. The first three years demanded **12-hour days, six days a week**."

**Why Hardware to IT Wasn't Such a Leap:**
Reed had always been interested in technology, and his hardware stores often had systems that were "ahead of their time" relative to the conservative hardware industry.

## **2. Growth Timeline & Strategic Evolution**

### **1998-2000: DataPro Launches as ISP**

**The Early Strategy:**
- **1998**: DataPro launched Internet services aimed at **small and medium businesses**
- **Pioneering offer**: First company to offer **cheap email services** for dial-up users
- **2000**: One of the **first ISPs in South Africa to become cash-flow positive**

**Reed's Reflection:**
> "Even when you have budgeted to lose money, it's horrid. Being cash-flow positive was huge for us."

**Management Philosophy:**
Reed learned from his first MD: *"Entrepreneurs must be managed loosely, but stringently."*

His four key metrics:
1. Debtors' days
2. Creditors' days  
3. Stock turnover
4. Profit

### **2000-2004: Management Buyout Drama**

**The Parent Company Problem:**
- Control Instruments (aviation/vehicle tracking electronics) wanted to sell non-core assets
- DataPro was thriving but didn't fit parent company's focus
- Internet boom was happening - Reed wanted to grow aggressively

**The Buyout Battle:**
- **Valuation**: DataPro worth R15 million
- **Price paid**: **R30 million** (double valuation)  
- **Why premium?** BoE Private Equity recognized value of DataPro's unmatched customer base
- **The plan**: Five-year journey to make shareholders R50 million

**The Banking Betrayal:**
- **Problem**: Nedbank took over BoE mid-journey
- **New agenda**: Nedbank wanted to sell DataPro to highest bidder
- **Threat**: Mweb made R65 million offer (fortunately rejected)

**Reed's Hard Lesson:**
> "If you ask for money from a bank, you're screwed. But if there's no alternative, hold onto as many shares as possible, double the size of the company so your money doubles, work hard for five years and **buy back your business**."

### **2004: JSE Listing via Reverse Takeover**

**The Casey Deal:**
- DataPro **reverse-listed on JSE's AltX** through acquisition by Casey Investment Holdings
- Casey founded by brothers who created and exited Esquire
- Casey changed name to **DataPro Group**
- Raised enough money to **part ways with BoE**

**Result**: Freedom from banks, capital for expansion

### **2005-2007: Aggressive Acquisition Phase**

**The Brand Strategy (2005):**
- Branded voice division as **"Vox Telecom"**
- Kept DataPro for business services

**Major Acquisitions Spree:**

**Regional ISPs:**
- **WickIT** (Durban-based regional ISP)
- **@lantic** (consumer-focused ISP, founded 1996)
- **Netralink** (Pretoria-based corporate ISP)
- **MJVNET** (consumer ISP)
- **XsiNet** (consumer ISP)
- **Shisas** (consumer ISP)

**Least-Cost Routing Empire:**
- **Definity Telecom** (4th largest LCR provider in SA)
- **Orion Telecom** (R380 million, 2006) - **Biggest LCR provider in SA**

**Reed's Acquisition Philosophy:**
> "If the company you take over is your core business, people are not an issue - we take virtually **none of them** into the fold. If it's not our core business, it's vital to buy a well-run company, which means we **bring the people on board**."

**Lesson Learned:**
> "These transactions have a major impact on both sides. Each time we conclude a deal, **both sides stop in their tracks for a few months**, which costs us a lot of money. It's vital to plan everything in great detail beforehand. **Rather take longer to conclude the deal and have the ability to hit the ground running**."

### **2007: DataPro Becomes Vox Telecom**

**The Transformation:**
- Renamed from DataPro Group to **Vox Telecom**
- Repositioned as **full-service telecommunications provider**
- Market cap: **R2.3 billion**
- Status: **Largest listed company on the AltX**

### **2008-2011: Financial Crisis & Survival**

**The Perfect Storm:**
- **2008 global financial crisis** hit hard
- Brokerage Vox used **went under**
- **Write-off**: **R60.8 million** in related losses
- Company severely damaged but survived

**2011: Private Buyout & Delisting:**
- Struck deal for **buyout and JSE delisting**
- **Leadership change**: Angus MacRobert (Internet Solutions veteran) appointed **co-CEO** alongside Reed

### **2013: New Generation Leadership**

**The Handover:**
- **January 1, 2013**: Douglas Reed and Angus MacRobert stepped down as co-CEOs
- **Jacques du Toit** (Orion Telecom CEO) promoted to Vox Telecom CEO
- **MacRobert**: Pursued other interests
- **Reed**: Stayed as Executive Head for Strategy and Innovation until January 2015

## **3. Jacques du Toit: The Entrepreneurial Pilot**

### **Background & Early Career**

**The Entrepreneur from Day One:**
- **Born**: 1973, Johannesburg
- **School**: Hoërskool Brandwag ("proper Afrikaans, East Rand school")
- **University**: BCom, University of Pretoria
- **Early ventures**:
  - Sold **compost** in high school
  - Sold **biltong** to friends and family
  - **Mobile bar business** at university (drinks services for functions)
  - Worked as **security guard** at Infoplan for spare cash

**The Cellular Revolution (1990s):**
- Part-time job selling **cellphones as freelance agent** for Vodac shop
- **Unique strategy**: While others focused on Jo'burg, Cape Town, Durban CBDs, he targeted **rural areas**
  - Thohoyandou, Polokwane, Mussina
  - Worked with **local farmers**, showing how mobile could change their lives
  - **Result**: Sold **100 phones per week** on the road

**Post-University:**
- Landed sales position at **Aztec Communications** (early independent cellular service provider)
- **Rapid rise**: Internal sales → external sales → national sales manager
- *"The right place at the right time with the right energy. The growth path was phenomenal."*

### **The Orion Journey (1999-2013)**

**1999: Joining the LCR Pioneer:**
- Left Aztec to join **Orion Cellular**
- Founded by **Don Tredoux** - "father of cellular least-cost routing" in SA
- **Least-Cost Routing (LCR)**: Took advantage of arbitrage opportunities across mobile operators' packages to offer cheaper calls

**Career progression at Orion:**
1. National channel development manager
2. National sales manager
3. Sales and marketing director
4. **CEO** (after DataPro acquired Orion for R380M in 2006)

**The Perfect Storm (2008-2009):**

When financial crisis hit, Orion faced existential threats:
- New regulations governing mobile interconnection rates
- Withdrawal of connection incentive bonuses by mobile operators
- Crashing economy

**Industry verdict**: "No business analyst gave Orion even a **1% chance of surviving**."

**Du Toit's Response**: **180-degree pivot**
- Shifted from LCR to **Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP)**
- Converged voice and data services
- Complete business model transformation

**His Philosophy:**
> "The lesson I have learnt in this industry is that if you can't adapt, you won't make it. You can't allow yourself to be rattled by change."

### **CEO Era (2013-Present)**

**First Three Years Focus (2013-2016):**
1. **Operational improvements**
   - Removed duplication across divisions
   - Introduced consistency in policies and processes
   - Created single vision for company

**The 2014 Pivot Point:**
- Shareholders (RMB, Metier, Investec) decided to **sell Vox**
- Extensive due diligence process
- **Decision**: Did NOT sell in the end

**Du Toit's Reflection:**
> "Although it was a daunting process and stifled the business to a degree, we learnt an enormous amount about ourselves. We learnt what the market and potential suitors like and don't like about us."

**Post-2016 Challenge:**
> "The challenge now is to take leap of faith: we need to take the leap from being **operationally focused to being sales focused**. That's probably been my biggest challenge: freeing up time to figure out how to go and find opportunities, to find new markets."

### **The Pilot Philosophy**

Du Toit is an **avid pilot** who owns:
- **Boeing Stearman** (1942 biplane, used for US military training/bombing)
- **Cessna 402** (modern twin-engine)

**Why flying matters to him:**
> "You are so focused on the plane and what will happen next. It's re-energising and an escape from reality. It's a very **disciplined sport**. There's **no room for error, no room for shortcuts**. Guys who take shortcuts come short every time."

**Flying the Stearman:**
> "Like riding a Harley Davidson. There are no tools to help you. Limited avionics. You can hardly see out of the cockpit. Just **smoke and oil, an open cockpit, bugs flying in your face**."

**Work-Life Balance:**
- Takes family (wife from high school, two sons) on **hunting expeditions** to farm in Limpopo
- *"It's about being outside in the bush, sitting around the campfire."*
- Vox **requires employees to take time out** and get away
- *"Everything is not about going to the gym or working 18-hour days, 365 days a year."*

## **4. Strategic Success Factors**

### **A. Business Market Focus (Not Consumer)**

**The Differentiation:**
Unlike Afrihost and WebAfrica, Vox focused primarily on **business and enterprise customers**, not residential consumers.

**Target Markets:**
- Small and medium businesses (SMBs)
- Large enterprises
- Corporate accounts
- Government contracts

**Key Evidence:**
- DataPro launched in 1998 **aimed at SMBs**
- Orion Telecom's LCR services saved **corporate clients R4.1 billion** since 1999
- Reed's initial strategy: **cheap email services for businesses** on dial-up

### **B. Least-Cost Routing Dominance**

**What is LCR?**
Cellular least-cost routing took advantage of pricing arbitrage across mobile operators' various packages to offer significantly cheaper mobile calls to businesses.

**Vox's LCR Empire:**
- Acquired **Definity Telecom** (4th largest LCR provider)
- Acquired **Orion Telecom** for R380M (largest LCR provider)
- Don Tredoux (Orion founder) considered **"father of cellular LCR"** in SA
- Saved government and business **over R4.1 billion** since 1999

**The Challenge:**
- 2008-2009: Regulatory changes and economic crisis threatened LCR model
- **Adaptation**: Pivoted to VoIP and converged voice/data services
- Jacques du Toit's 180-degree transformation saved Orion from 1% survival odds

### **C. Strategic Fibre Play: Frogfoot Acquisition (2015)**

**The Game-Changing Deal:**
- **July 2015**: Vox acquired **Frogfoot Networks**
- **Strategy**: Fast-track Vox's fibre deployment using Frogfoot's installed network
- **Focus areas**: Fibre-to-the-Business (FTTB) and Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH)

**CEO Jacques du Toit:**
> "The acquisition will see Vox Telecom fast-tracking its **own fibre strategy** by leveraging the existing skills, processes and the installed fibre network of Frogfoot Networks."

**Impact:**
- Gave Vox footprint in **fibre-to-home and fibre-to-business** markets
- Enabled fibre deployment in **major cities and smaller towns** (Bloemfontein, Mmabatho, etc.)
- **Current status (2023)**: Frogfoot's network passes **350,000 homes**, connecting **135,000**

**Multi-Million Rand Fibre Plan (2019):**
Vox pledged to spur economic activity in **small towns and outlying areas** with extensive fibre network rollouts.

[TechCentral](https://techcentral.co.za/vox-buys-frogfoot-in-fibre-play/192922/)

### **D. Vertical Integration Strategy**

**From Services to Infrastructure:**
Vox didn't just offer ISP services - they **owned the infrastructure**:

1. **Voice/LCR Services** (Vox Orion division)
2. **Data/ISP Services** (DataPro/Vox ISP division)
3. **Fibre Infrastructure** (Frogfoot Networks subsidiary)
4. **IT/Cloud Services** (later additions)

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Control over entire value chain
- Better margins than pure ISPs
- Ability to serve enterprise customers end-to-end

### **E. Private Equity & Financial Strategy**

**The Buyout Journey:**

**2011**: First buyout and delisting
- Lereko Metier Capital Growth Fund + Investec Bank
- Took company **private from JSE**

**2019**: Shareholder Restructure
- Vox shareholders including **RMB (FirstRand)** bought out Investec
- **Deal value**: R2 billion ($130 million)
- **Decision**: Did **NOT sell** to external buyers despite market interest
- **Strategic reset**: Halted corporate action process to "accelerate growth based on market potential"

**Banking Partners:**
- **RMB Ventures**: Helped shape Vox's strategy
- Long-term partnership focused on growth, not quick exit

**Jacques du Toit & RMB's Cassim Motala:**
> "We joined the consortium in order to delist the business from the JSE. We started working with the management team around where to go from there."

### **F. Adaptability as Core Competence**

**Multiple Existential Pivots:**

1. **2000**: Dial-up to ADSL transition
2. **2008-2009**: LCR to VoIP transformation (Orion survival)
3. **2015**: Voice/data to fibre infrastructure (Frogfoot)
4. **2022**: Telecom to integrated ICT (Vivica transformation)

**Jacques du Toit's Mantra:**
> "If you can't adapt, you won't make it. You can't allow yourself to be rattled by change."

---

## **5. The Vivica Transformation (2022)**

### **Why Rebrand from Vox to Vivica?**

**The Complexity Problem:**
By 2020, Vox had become a **"complex" conglomerate** with multiple business units:
- Vox Telecom (ISP)
- Frogfoot Networks (fibre infrastructure)
- Vox Orion (voice/LCR)
- Everlytic (email marketing platform)
- Braintree (consulting)
- Guardian Eye (IoT/security)
- Multiple other divisions

**July 2022 Restructure:**
- **Vox Holdings** rebranded to **Vivica Group**
- Restructured into **several sister companies**
- Vox Telecom **retained** as ISP brand under Vivica umbrella
- Created smaller "incubator" businesses
- Launched new subsidiary **Nymbis Cloud Solutions**

**The Rationale:**
- **Simplify** business structure
- **Position for accelerated growth**
- Move beyond pure telecommunications
- **Avoid confusion** - Vox brand too closely associated with ISP

**CEO Jacques du Toit:**
Company was looking to simplify and **"launch new brands under its stable"** while avoiding job losses.

**2020 Status Before Rebrand:**
- **Almost 2,000 employees**
- Several business partners
- **R2.9 billion turnover**
- Evolved from telecom to **market-leading integrated ICT and infrastructure provider**

---

## **7. Challenges & Market Perception**

### **The Sentiment Problem**

**Media Perception Issues:**
- **Negative sentiment scores** in online media analysis
- Contrasts sharply with Afrihost's positive brand perception
- Suggests challenges in **brand positioning** and **PR effectiveness**

**Possible Causes:**
1. **B2B focus** = less consumer visibility and advocacy

- **24/7/365 support** availability
- Business customers appreciate reliability

**Negatives:**
- Lower overall satisfaction scores vs. Afrihost, Cool Ideas
- Some reviews mention pricing concerns
- Less consumer-market presence

## **8. Key Success Lessons from Vox**

### **What Worked:**

1. **Non-Traditional Background**: Reed's hardware retail experience brought discipline and metrics-focused management

2. **Business Market Focus**: Targeting **SMBs and enterprises** instead of consumers created stable revenue and higher margins

3. **LCR Dominance**: Becoming the **largest least-cost routing provider** generated massive B2B revenue

4. **Strategic Acquisitions**: Methodical approach to M&A - planned in detail, brought right people on board

5. **Vertical Integration**: Owning infrastructure (Frogfoot) plus services created competitive moat

6. **Adaptation Culture**: Survived multiple existential threats through **180-degree pivots**

7. **Private Equity Partnership**: Long-term relationship with RMB provided capital without pressure for quick exit

8. **Leadership Continuity**: Jacques du Toit's **12+ years as CEO** (since 2013) provided strategic stability

9. **Cash Flow Discipline**: One of first ISPs to achieve **cash-flow positive** (2000)

10. **Calculated Risk-Taking**: Reed's willingness to **double down** (salary cut, bought 30% stake) when opportunity arose

### **What Challenged Them:**

1. **Brand Complexity**: Multiple divisions and brands created confusion until 2022 Vivica restructure

2. **Consumer Perception**: Negative sentiment scores suggest struggle with residential market positioning

3. **Financial Crisis Impact**: R60.8M write-off in 2008 severely damaged company

4. **LCR Disruption**: Regulatory changes nearly killed Orion (survived only through massive pivot)

5. **Private Equity Pressure**: BoE/Nedbank relationship became problematic; learned "banks will screw you"

6. **Operational vs. Sales Balance**: Du Toit acknowledged struggle to shift from operational focus to sales-driven growth

## **Conclusion: Vox's Unique Path**

Vox Telecom represents a **fundamentally different ISP success model** compared to Afrihost and WebAfrica:

**The Enterprise Formula**: While Afrihost won hearts with consumer service and WebAfrica consolidated through M&A, Vox built success on **B2B relationships, least-cost routing dominance, and vertical integration** through fibre infrastructure ownership.

**The Hardware Store to Telecom Story**: Douglas Reed's unconventional journey from running hardware stores to building a R2.9B telecom empire demonstrates that **non-traditional backgrounds can bring valuable discipline and metrics-focused management** to tech industries.

**The Adaptation Masters**: Vox's survival through multiple near-death experiences - the 2008 financial crisis, LCR disruption, regulatory changes - proves that **adaptability trumps perfection**. Jacques du Toit's 180-degree Orion pivot from 1% survival odds showcases this DNA.

**The Infrastructure Advantage**: Unlike pure-play ISPs, Vox's **ownership of Frogfoot Networks** creates a sustainable competitive moat. They don't just sell connectivity - they own the pipes.

**The Private vs. Public Journey**: Vox's path from JSE-listed (2004-2011) to private equity-backed demonstrates that **strategic partnerships matter more than public market validation** for long-term growth.

**The Lesson**: You can build ISP success through **B2B focus, infrastructure ownership, and financial discipline** rather than consumer brand love - but it requires **relentless adaptation and long-term strategic vision**.

Vox's 25+ year journey proves that **multiple winning formulas exist** in telecommunications - theirs was built on enterprise relationships, vertical integration, and the ability to pivot 180 degrees when the market demanded it.
