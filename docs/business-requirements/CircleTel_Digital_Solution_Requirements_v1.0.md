## 1. Product Vision

### What's CircleTel's Main Business Problem You're Solving?

CircleTel is addressing multiple interconnected problems in the South African SMB market:

#### Core Connectivity & IT Challenges:
- **Deployment Delays:** Traditional fibre takes 15-45 days vs CircleTel's 3-5 day deployment using MTN Tarana G1 wireless
- **Affordability Gap:** Enterprise MSPs require R15,000+ monthly minimums whilst local IT providers are unreliable
- **Service Fragmentation:** SMBs manage 5-10 different vendors (connectivity, cloud, IT support, software licenses)
- **Digital Divide:** Townships and underserved communities lack affordable, reliable connectivity options

#### Partner & Sales Ecosystem Gaps:
- **Partner Enablement:** ISPs and IT resellers lack tools to sell complex bundled solutions effectively
- **Quote Complexity:** Manual quoting processes take days for multi-service bundles
- **Commission Tracking:** Partners struggle with manual commission calculations and delayed payments
- **Sales Tools:** No unified platform for product training, marketing materials, and deal registration
- **Configuration Errors:** 30% of orders have configuration mistakes leading to installation delays

#### Service Delivery & Support Inefficiencies:
- **Field Service Chaos:** No visibility into technician location, skills, or availability
- **Installation Delays:** Poor scheduling leads to 40% first-visit failure rate
- **Support Fragmentation:** Customers contact multiple numbers for different services
- **SLA Violations:** Manual tracking results in 25% of SLAs being missed
- **Customer Experience:** No proactive communication about service delivery status

#### Billing & Compliance Complexity:
- **Invoice Overload:** SMBs process multiple invoices monthly from various digital service providers
- **Compliance Burden:** RICA and POPIA requirements overwhelm businesses without dedicated compliance teams
- **Cash Flow Issues:** Unpredictable billing and poor payment terms from multiple vendors

#### Zoho Development Standards

**Deluge Script Standards:**
```javascript
// Function naming convention for Zoho Creator
void automation.processServiceActivation(int customerId, string serviceType)
{
    try 
    {
        // Fetch customer record
        customer = zoho.crm.getRecordById("Accounts", customerId);
        
        // Validate prerequisites
        if(customer.get("status") != "Active")
        {
            throw "Customer account not active";
        }
        
        // Process activation via MCP
        mcpResponse = invokeurl
        [
            url: "https://circletel-zoho-900485550.zohomcp.com/mcp/message"
            type: POST
            parameters: {
                "key": "e2f4039d67d5fb236177fbce811a0ff0",
                "action": "activate_service",
                "customer_id": customerId,
                "service": serviceType
            }
        ];
        
        // Update CRM record
        updateMap = Map();
        updateMap.put("Service_Status", "Active");
        updateMap.put("Activation_Date", zoho.currentdate);
        zoho.crm.updateRecord("Services", serviceId, updateMap);
        
        // Send notification
        sendmail
        [
            from: zoho.adminuserid
            to: customer.get("Email")
            subject: "Service Activated"
            message: "Your " + serviceType + " service is now active"
        ]
    }
    catch (e)
    {
        // Log error to Zoho Analytics
        zoho.analytics.addRow("CircleTel_Analytics", "Error_Log", 
            {"error": e, "function": "processServiceActivation", "timestamp": zoho.currenttime});
    }
}
```

**Zoho Flow Integration Patterns:**
```yaml
Flow Design Standards:
  - Naming: DEPT_PROCESS_VERSION (e.g., BILLING_INVOICE_GENERATION_V1)
  - Error Handling: Always include error branches
  - Logging: Track all flow executions in Analytics
  - Testing: Maintain sandbox flows for testing
  
Common Patterns:
  Customer Onboarding:
    Trigger: New CRM Account
    Actions:
      1. Create in Zoho Billing
      2. Setup in Zoho Desk
      3. Generate in Zoho Creator (RICA)
      4. Notify via Zoho Cliq
      5. Log in Zoho Analytics
  
  Service Provisioning:
    Trigger: Zoho Billing subscription
    Actions:
      1. Call MTN API via webhook
      2. Update Zoho CRM
      3. Create Zoho Projects task
      4. Send Zoho Sign contract
      5. Track in Zoho Analytics
```

**Zoho API Integration Standards:**
```typescript
// TypeScript wrapper for Zoho APIs
class ZohoMCPClient {
    private readonly baseUrl = 'https://circletel-zoho-900485550.zohomcp.com';
    private readonly apiKey = 'e2f4039d67d5fb236177fbce811a0ff0';
    
    async activateService(customerId: string, serviceType: string): Promise<ServiceResponse> {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/mcp/message`, {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                    'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    key: this.apiKey,
                    action: 'activate_service',
                    customer_id: customerId,
                    service_type: serviceType,
                    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
                })
            });
            
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error(`MCP Error: ${response.status}`);
            }
            
            return await response.json();
        } catch (error) {
            // Log to monitoring
            logger.error('Zoho MCP activation failed', { error, customerId, serviceType });
            throw new ServiceActivationError(error.message);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Coding Standards

**General Principles:**
```typescript
// File naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
customer-billing.service.ts
CustomerDashboard.tsx

// Clear function signatures with TypeScript
interface BillingRequest {
  customerId: string;
  services: ServiceType[];
  billingPeriod: DateRange;
}

async function generateInvoice(request: BillingRequest): Promise<Invoice> {
  // Implementation
}

// Comprehensive error handling
try {
  const result = await billingService.process(request);
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Billing failed', { error, request });
  throw new BillingException(error.message, error.code);
}
```

**API Design Standards:**
```yaml
Conventions:
  - RESTful resource naming: /api/v1/customers/{id}/invoices
  - Consistent HTTP status codes
  - Pagination: offset/limit or cursor-based
  - Filtering: query parameters
  - Sorting: sort=field:asc|desc
  
Response Format:
  Success:
    {
      "success": true,
      "data": {},
      "meta": {
        "timestamp": "2025-09-24T10:00:00Z",
        "version": "1.0"
      }
    }
  
  Error:
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": "BILLING_001",
        "message": "Customer not found",
        "details": {}
      }
    }
```

**Documentation Requirements:**
```typescript
/**
 * Generates monthly invoice for customer
 * @param customerId - Unique customer identifier
 * @param billingPeriod - Start and end date for billing
 * @returns Generated invoice with line items
 * @throws {BillingException} When customer not found or billing fails
 * @example
 * const invoice = await generateInvoice('CUST-001', {
 *   start: '2025-09-01',
 *   end: '2025-09-30'
 * });
 */
```

  Feature: Customer Billing
    As a customer
    I want to receive a consolidated invoice
    So that I can manage payments easily
    
  Scenario: Generate monthly invoice
    Given I have active services
    When the billing cycle ends
    Then I should receive an invoice
    And it should include all services
    And payment should be processed

  correlationId: req.correlationId,
  customerId: customer.id,
  invoiceId: invoice.id,
  amount: invoice.total,
  duration: performanceTimer.end()
});
