# SME SkyFibre Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented SME SkyFibre wireless packages for small to medium businesses (5-50 employees), ensuring proper separation from consumer packages in the business customer journey.

## Implemented Features

### 1. SME Package Database Migration ✅
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251005000003_add_sme_skyfibre_packages.sql`

Added 3 SME packages to `service_packages` table:

| Package | Speed | Price | Target | Data Allowance | SLA |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|----------------|-----|
| SME Essential | 50 Mbps | R999/month | 5-15 employees | 1 TB (400GB business + 600GB after hours) | 98.5% |
| SME Professional | 100 Mbps | R1,499/month | 15-30 employees | 1.5 TB (600GB business + 900GB after hours) | 99.0% |
| SME Premium | 200 Mbps | R2,299/month | 30-50 employees | 2 TB (800GB business + 1200GB after hours) | 99.5% |

**Key Features**:
- MTN Tarana G1 Fixed Wireless technology
- Symmetrical speeds (upload = download)
- Business hours data allocation vs after-hours
- Static IP included
- Business support with defined response times
- 12-month contracts

### 2. Product Category Mapping Fix ✅
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251005000004_fix_product_category_mapping.sql`

**Problem**: Inconsistent product categories between `service_type_mapping` (uppercase) and `service_packages` (lowercase)

**Solution**:
- Updated constraint to accept both systems
- Migrated all mappings to lowercase: `wireless`, `fibre_consumer`, `fibre_business`, `lte`, `5g`
- Ensures proper package filtering in coverage API

### 3. Consumer Package Visibility Fix ✅
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251005000005_fix_consumer_package_visibility.sql`

**Problem**: Consumer SkyFibre and HomeFibre packages were showing for business customers

**Solution**:
- Changed consumer SkyFibre from `customer_type='both'` to `customer_type='consumer'`
- Changed HomeFibre from `customer_type='both'` to `customer_type='consumer'`
- Business customers now only see appropriate packages

### 4. Frontend Package Display ✅
**File**: `app/business/packages/page.tsx` (lines 51-83)

**Enhancements**:
- Added SME package detection (`isSME`)
- Proper technology labeling: "SkyFibre SME", "MTN 5G", "MTN LTE"
- SLA display for SME packages: "98.5-99.5% Uptime SLA"
- Seamless integration with existing business package flow

## Package Visibility Matrix

### Business Customers (customerType='business')

#### With FTTB Coverage:
- ✅ BizFibreConnect (fibre_business)
- ✅ SkyFibre SME (wireless fallback)
- ✅ MTN 5G/LTE (mobile data)

#### Without FTTB Coverage:
- ❌ BizFibreConnect (requires FTTB)
- ✅ SkyFibre SME (wireless)
- ✅ MTN 5G/LTE (mobile data)

#### Never Shown:
- ❌ HomeFibreConnect (consumer fibre)
- ❌ SkyFibre consumer packages (Starter, Essential, Pro)

### Consumer Customers (customerType='consumer')

- ✅ HomeFibreConnect (fibre_consumer)
- ✅ SkyFibre consumer (wireless)
- ✅ MTN 5G/LTE (mobile data)
- ❌ BizFibreConnect (business only)
- ❌ SkyFibre SME (business only)

## Database Schema

### service_packages Table (SME additions)
```sql
-- SME packages marked as:
customer_type: 'business'
product_category: 'wireless'
requires_fttb_coverage: false
service_type: 'SkyFibre'
```

### service_type_mapping Table (updated)
```sql
-- Mappings now use lowercase categories:
uncapped_wireless → wireless
5g → 5g
lte → lte
fibre → fibre_consumer (consumer) / fibre_business (business)
```

## API Integration

### Coverage Packages Endpoint
**Route**: `GET /api/coverage/packages?leadId={id}&customerType=business`

**Flow**:
1. Check MTN wireless coverage at location
2. Check FTTB coverage for business customers
3. Filter packages by:
   - `customer_type` IN ('business', 'both') OR ('consumer', 'both')
   - `requires_fttb_coverage` based on availability
   - `active` = true
4. Return matched packages

**Result for Business (no FTTB)**:
- 3x MTN 5G packages
- 11x MTN LTE packages
- 3x SkyFibre SME packages
- Total: ~17 packages

## Testing

### Database Verification ✅
```sql
-- Confirmed 3 SME packages inserted
SELECT name, price, customer_type, product_category
FROM service_packages
WHERE name LIKE '%SME%';

-- Results:
-- SkyFibre SME Essential: R999, business, wireless
-- SkyFibre SME Professional: R1499, business, wireless
-- SkyFibre SME Premium: R2299, business, wireless
```

### Package Filtering Verification ✅
```sql
-- Business customer query (no FTTB)
SELECT name, product_category, customer_type
FROM service_packages
WHERE customer_type IN ('business', 'both')
  AND requires_fttb_coverage = false
ORDER BY product_category, price;

-- Results:
-- ✅ 3 MTN 5G packages
-- ✅ 11 MTN LTE packages
-- ✅ 3 SkyFibre SME packages
-- ❌ 0 consumer packages
```

### Frontend Updates
1. `app/business/packages/page.tsx` - Enhanced package transformation logic

### Documentation
1. `docs/implementation/SME_SKYFIBRE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Admin UI**: Create admin page for managing `service_packages` table
2. **Package Analytics**: Track SME package selection rates
3. **Coverage Expansion**: Add more wireless providers (Rain, Vodacom)
4. **Upsell Logic**: Recommend SME packages over consumer for eligible businesses

### Future Provider Integration
The system is designed to support additional SME wireless providers:
- Rain 5G Business
- Vodacom Business LTE/5G
- Telkom Business Wireless

## Success Criteria

✅ SME packages added to database
✅ Product categories standardized (lowercase)
✅ Consumer packages hidden from business customers
✅ Frontend displays SME packages correctly
✅ Package filtering logic works end-to-end
✅ Documentation complete

## Deployment Notes
