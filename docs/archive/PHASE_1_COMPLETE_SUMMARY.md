## 🎯 What Was Built

Phase 1 establishes the complete foundation for CircleTel's dual customer journey system:

### Database Infrastructure ✅
- **5 New Tables**:
  - `coverage_leads` - No-coverage lead capture with Zoho integration
  - `consumer_orders` - B2C order tracking (16 status states)
  - `business_quotes` - B2B quote generation with auto-calculations
  - `kyc_documents` - FICA document management with verification
  - `order_status_history` - Complete audit trail for all changes

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Auto-generated order numbers (`ORD-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`)
  - Auto-generated quote numbers (`QTE-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`)
  - Auto-calculated quote totals (subtotal, VAT, total)
  - Auto-tracked status changes (triggers populate history)
  - Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
  - 15+ indexes for query performance

### Zoho CRM Integration ✅
- **Lead Capture Service** (`/lib/zoho/lead-capture.ts`):
  - Create leads in Zoho from coverage checker
  - Map customer types (Consumer, SMME, Enterprise)
  - Track coverage availability and requirements
  - Sync status tracking (pending, synced, failed)
  - Batch sync capabilities
  - Lead conversion to contacts/deals

- **Custom Fields Mapped**:
  - Customer_Type, Requested_Service, Requested_Speed
  - Budget_Range, Coverage_Available
  - Campaign_Source, Referral_Code

### Notification System ✅
- **Email Service** (`/lib/notifications/notification-service.ts`):
  - 10 email templates (order confirmation, quotes, KYC, installation)
  - Resend API integration
  - HTML email templates with CircleTel branding
  - Template variables for personalization

- **SMS Service**:
  - 6 SMS templates (confirmations, reminders, activation)
  - Short message format optimized for SMS
  - Sender ID: "CircleTel"

- **Templates Available**:
  - Order confirmation, payment received
  - Installation scheduled, reminders
  - Quote sent, quote reminders
  - KYC upload requests, approval/rejection
  - Lead captured (admin), coverage available

### API Routes ✅
- `GET /api/admin/coverage-leads` - List leads with filtering
- `POST /api/admin/coverage-leads` - Create new lead
- `GET /api/admin/coverage-leads/[id]` - Get single lead
- `PATCH /api/admin/coverage-leads/[id]` - Update lead
- `DELETE /api/admin/coverage-leads/[id]` - Delete lead

### TypeScript Types ✅
- **Complete Type Safety** (`/lib/types/customer-journey.ts`):
  - 6 enums (CustomerType, LeadSource, OrderStatus, QuoteStatus, etc.)
  - 7 main interfaces (CoverageLead, ConsumerOrder, BusinessQuote, etc.)
  - 4 input types for API requests
  - 3 summary types for list views
  - 4 status configuration objects with colors and icons

### UI Components ✅
- **OrderStatusBadge Component** (`/components/customer-journey/OrderStatusBadge.tsx`):
  - Color-coded badges (success, warning, error, info)
  - Icon support for visual clarity
  - 3 size variants (sm, md, lg)
  - 4 specialized variants:
    - `<ConsumerOrderStatusBadge />`
    - `<BusinessQuoteStatusBadge />`
    - `<LeadStatusBadge />`
    - `<KycStatusBadge />`
  - `<OrderStatusProgress />` progress indicator

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before proceeding to Phase 2, verify:

- [ ] **Database Migration Applied**
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM coverage_leads; -- Should return 0 (empty table)
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM consumer_orders; -- Should return 0
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM business_quotes; -- Should return 0
  ```

- [ ] **Functions Working**
  ```sql
  SELECT generate_order_number(); -- Returns ORD-YYYYMMDD-XXXX
  SELECT generate_quote_number(); -- Returns QTE-YYYYMMDD-XXXX
  ```

- [ ] **Triggers Active**
  ```sql
  -- Test quote calculation
  INSERT INTO business_quotes (...) VALUES (...);
  SELECT subtotal, vat_amount, total_amount FROM business_quotes WHERE id = 'xxx';
  -- Should show auto-calculated values
  ```

- [ ] **API Routes Responding**
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3001/api/admin/coverage-leads
  # Should return { success: true, leads: [], total_count: 0 }
  ```

- [ ] **TypeScript Compiles**
  ```bash
  npm run type-check
  # Should pass with no errors
  ```

- [ ] **Components Render**
  ```tsx
  import { ConsumerOrderStatusBadge } from '@/components/customer-journey/OrderStatusBadge';
  <ConsumerOrderStatusBadge status="pending" />
  // Should render orange badge
  ```
