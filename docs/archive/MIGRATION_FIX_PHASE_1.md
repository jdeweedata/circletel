# üîß Migration Fix - Phase 1 Customer Journey

> **Issue**: Foreign key constraint error on `coverage_checks` table
> **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
> **Migration**: `20251019000003_create_customer_journey_system.sql`

---

## ‚ùå Error You Encountered

```
ERROR: 42703: column "email" does not exist
FROM SQL Editor in Supabase
```

**Root Cause**: The migration referenced a `coverage_checks` table that doesn't exist yet in your database. When Supabase tried to create the foreign key constraint, it failed, causing the entire transaction to roll back.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Changed Lines:

**Before** (line 138):
```sql
coverage_check_id UUID REFERENCES coverage_checks(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
```

**After** (line 138):
```sql
coverage_check_id UUID, -- References coverage_checks(id) if it exists
```

This change was made in **3 places**:
1. `coverage_leads` table (line ~138)
2. `consumer_orders` table (line ~230)
3. `business_quotes` table (line ~347)

### Why This Fixes It:

- **Before**: Migration failed because it tried to create a foreign key to a non-existent table
- **After**: Column is created as a regular UUID field (no foreign key constraint)
- **Impact**: None - the column still stores the coverage check ID, just without database-level enforcement
- **Future**: When you create the `coverage_checks` table, you can add the foreign key constraint later

## üöÄ How to Apply the Corrected Migration

### Step 1: Clean Up Previous Attempt (if needed)

If you already tried to run the migration, first clean up:

```sql
-- Drop any partially created tables (in correct order)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS order_status_history CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS kyc_documents CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS business_quotes CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS consumer_orders CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS coverage_leads CASCADE;

-- Drop any created types
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS kyc_verification_status CASCADE;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS kyc_document_type CASCADE;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS quote_status CASCADE;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS order_status CASCADE;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS lead_source CASCADE;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS customer_type CASCADE;
```

### Step 2: Apply Corrected Migration

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/agyjovdugmtopasyvlng

2. **SQL Editor** ‚Üí **New Query**

3. **Copy corrected migration**:
   - Open: `supabase/migrations/20251019000003_create_customer_journey_system.sql`
   - Select All (Ctrl+A)
   - Copy (Ctrl+C)

4. **Paste and Run**:
   - Paste into SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)
   - Click **"Run"** or press Ctrl+Enter
   - Wait for: **"Success. No rows returned"**

### Step 3: Verify Tables Created

```sql
-- Check all 5 tables exist
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN (
  'coverage_leads',
  'consumer_orders',
  'business_quotes',
  'kyc_documents',
  'order_status_history'
)
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected**: 5 rows

```
business_quotes
consumer_orders
coverage_leads
kyc_documents
order_status_history
```

### Step 4: Test Functions

```sql
-- Test order number generation
SELECT generate_order_number();
-- Expected: ORD-20251019-XXXX

-- Test quote number generation
SELECT generate_quote_number();
-- Expected: QTE-20251019-XXXX
```

## üß™ Quick Functional Test

Test that everything works:

```sql
-- 1. Create a test coverage lead
INSERT INTO coverage_leads (
  customer_type,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email,
  phone,
  address,
  city,
  province,
  lead_source,
  status
) VALUES (
  'consumer',
  'Test',
  'User',
  'test@example.com',
  '+27821234567',
  '123 Test Street',
  'Johannesburg',
  'Gauteng',
  'coverage_checker',
  'new'
) RETURNING id, email, created_at;

-- 2. Verify lead was created
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_leads FROM coverage_leads;
-- Expected: 1

-- 3. Test consumer order with auto-generated order number
INSERT INTO consumer_orders (
  order_number,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email,
  phone,
  installation_address,
  package_name,
  package_speed,
  package_price,
  installation_fee,
  lead_source
) VALUES (
  generate_order_number(),
  'Jane',
  'Smith',
  'jane@example.com',
  '+27821234568',
  '456 Oak Avenue',
  'BizFibre Connect Pro',
  '100/100 Mbps',
  2999.00,
  3500.00,
  'coverage_checker'
) RETURNING order_number, status, created_at;

-- 4. Test business quote with auto-calculations
INSERT INTO business_quotes (
  quote_number,
  company_name,
  contact_first_name,
  contact_last_name,
  contact_email,
  contact_phone,
  business_address,
  package_name,
  package_speed,
  monthly_recurring,
  installation_fee,
  router_cost,
  valid_until,
  lead_source
) VALUES (
  generate_quote_number(),
  'Test Corp (Pty) Ltd',
  'John',
  'Doe',
  'john@testcorp.com',
  '+27821234569',
  '789 Business Park',
  'BizFibre Connect Ultra',
  '200/200 Mbps',
  4373.00,
  3500.00,
  1200.00,
  CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days',
  'business_inquiry'
) RETURNING
  quote_number,
  monthly_recurring,
  installation_fee,
  router_cost,
  subtotal,
  vat_amount,
  total_amount;

-- Verify auto-calculations:
-- monthly_recurring: 4373.00
-- installation_fee: 3500.00
-- router_cost: 1200.00
-- subtotal: 9073.00 (4373 + 3500 + 1200)
-- vat_amount: 1360.95 (9073 * 0.15)
-- total_amount: 10433.95 (9073 + 1360.95)

-- 5. Check status history was auto-created
SELECT
  entity_type,
  entity_id,
  old_status,
  new_status,
  automated
FROM order_status_history
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected: 3 records (1 lead, 1 order, 1 quote)

-- 6. Clean up test data
DELETE FROM business_quotes WHERE company_name = 'Test Corp (Pty) Ltd';
DELETE FROM consumer_orders WHERE email = 'jane@example.com';
DELETE FROM coverage_leads WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Verify cleanup
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM coverage_leads; -- Expected: 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM consumer_orders; -- Expected: 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM business_quotes; -- Expected: 0
```

## ‚úÖ What Should Work Now

After applying the corrected migration:

- ‚úÖ All 5 tables created successfully
- ‚úÖ All enums created (customer_type, lead_source, order_status, etc.)
- ‚úÖ All indexes created
- ‚úÖ All triggers working (auto-update timestamps, auto-calculate totals, auto-track status)
- ‚úÖ All functions working (generate_order_number, generate_quote_number)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies enabled
- ‚úÖ No foreign key errors

## üìù About the Foreign Key Removal

### Is This a Problem?

**No** - removing the foreign key constraint is safe because:

1. **Data Integrity**: Your application code will still enforce the relationship
2. **Flexibility**: You can create the `coverage_checks` table later
3. **Performance**: No change in query performance
4. **Functionality**: The column still stores the coverage check ID

### When Will We Add the Foreign Key?

You can add the foreign key constraint later when you create the `coverage_checks` table:

```sql
-- After creating coverage_checks table:
ALTER TABLE coverage_leads
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_coverage_leads_coverage_check
FOREIGN KEY (coverage_check_id)
REFERENCES coverage_checks(id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE consumer_orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_consumer_orders_coverage_check
FOREIGN KEY (coverage_check_id)
REFERENCES coverage_checks(id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE business_quotes
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_business_quotes_coverage_check
FOREIGN KEY (coverage_check_id)
REFERENCES coverage_checks(id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

## üêõ Other Potential Issues

### Issue: Type already exists

**Error**: `type "customer_type" already exists`

**Solution**: Migration uses `DO $$ BEGIN ... EXCEPTION WHEN duplicate_object THEN null; END $$;` pattern - this is safe, types are skipped if they exist.

### Issue: Table already exists

**Error**: `relation "coverage_leads" already exists`

**Solution**: Migration uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` - tables are skipped if they exist. To recreate, use the cleanup script in Step 1.

### Issue: Index already exists

**Error**: `relation "idx_coverage_leads_email" already exists`

**Solution**: Migration uses `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` - indexes are skipped if they exist.

## üìö Next Steps

After successful migration:

1. **Verify all tables**: Run verification queries above ‚úÖ
2. **Test functions**: Run function tests above ‚úÖ
3. **Run functional test**: Insert test data and verify triggers ‚úÖ
4. **Check documentation**: Review `PHASE_1_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`
5. **Start Phase 2**: Begin building consumer journey pages

---

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If you encounter other errors:

1. **Copy the exact error message** from Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Check which line failed** (Supabase shows line numbers)
3. **Run verification queries** to see what was created
4. **Check Supabase logs** for more details

Common verification queries:

```sql
-- Check what tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check what types exist
SELECT typname FROM pg_type
WHERE typnamespace = (SELECT oid FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname = 'public')
ORDER BY typname;

-- Check what functions exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY routine_name;
```
