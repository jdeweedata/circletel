## Automated Playwright Test Script

I can help you run these tests automatically! Just tell me when:

1. Migration is applied
2. Dev server is running
3. You're ready to test

Then I'll use the Playwright MCP to:
- Navigate through all pages
- Fill forms
- Click buttons
- Take screenshots
- Verify results

## Manual Testing Checklist

If you want to test manually (without Playwright):

- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/products/approvals`
- [ ] See 5 pending products from Excel import
- [ ] Click Approve on first product
- [ ] Verify product moves to Approved tab
- [ ] Click Reject on second product
- [ ] Enter rejection reason
- [ ] Verify product moves to Rejected tab

- [ ] Verify notifications show import info
- [ ] Query database to confirm product in `service_packages`

## Next Steps

Once migration is applied, let me know and I'll:

1. Run the E2E test script
2. Guide you through Playwright testing
3. Take screenshots at each step
4. Verify everything works end-to-end

**Ready to proceed?** Just confirm:
- [ ] Migration applied
