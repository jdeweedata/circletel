## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Variant Pattern System
```typescript
// Type-safe variant support
export type OrderVariant = "wireless" | "home-internet" | "business"

// Configuration-driven behavior
const getVariantConfig = (variant: OrderVariant) => {
  const configs = {
    wireless: { /* wireless-specific config */ },
    "home-internet": { /* home-internet-specific config */ },
    business: { /* business-specific config */ }
  }
  return configs[variant]
}

// Single component, multiple behaviors
<UnifiedOrderForm variant="wireless" packageId={packageId} />
<UnifiedOrderForm variant="home-internet" packageId={packageId} />
<UnifiedOrderForm variant="business" packageId={packageId} />
```

### Benefits of New Architecture
1. **Single Source of Truth:** One component for all order flows
2. **Type Safety:** TypeScript variant pattern prevents errors
3. **Easy Maintenance:** Update once, applies everywhere
4. **Rapid Experimentation:** Add new variants without duplication
5. **Future-Ready:** Foundation for A/B testing and Phase 3 features
