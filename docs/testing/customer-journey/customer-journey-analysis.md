**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-03
**Analyst:** Claude Code
**Project:** CircleTel NextJS Platform

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the customer journey from coverage check through to order placement, identifying friction points and opportunities for improvement. The platform currently has **separate flows for consumer and business customers**, but there are significant opportunities to streamline both journeys and reduce conversion friction.

---

## Current Customer Journey Flows

### 1. Consumer Customer Journey (Primary Flow)

**Entry Points:**
- Homepage Hero ([app/page.tsx:1](app/page.tsx#L1)) ‚Üí Coverage Checker
- Home Internet page ([app/home-internet/page.tsx:1](app/home-internet/page.tsx#L1))
- Wireless packages page

**Journey Steps:**

#### Step 1: Coverage Check
- **Component:** [CoverageChecker.tsx:67-329](components/coverage/CoverageChecker.tsx#L67)
- **User Action:** Enter address and click "Show me my deals"
- **Backend Flow:**
  1. Geocode address ‚Üí `/api/geocode` ([CoverageChecker.tsx:97](components/coverage/CoverageChecker.tsx#L97))
  2. Create lead entry ‚Üí `/api/coverage/lead` ([CoverageChecker.tsx:108](components/coverage/CoverageChecker.tsx#L108))
  3. Check coverage ‚Üí `/api/coverage/packages?leadId={id}` ([CoverageChecker.tsx:125](components/coverage/CoverageChecker.tsx#L125))
- **Result:** Redirect to `/packages/{leadId}` ([Hero.tsx:31](components/home/Hero.tsx#L31))

#### Step 2: Package Selection
- **Page:** [app/packages/[leadId]/page.tsx:221-502](app/packages/[leadId]/page.tsx#L221)
- **Features:**
  - Hero section showing coverage confirmation
  - Tabbed filtering (All, Fibre, Wireless, 5G)
  - Color-coded package cards with service-specific styling
  - "Get this deal" CTA on each card
- **User Action:** Click package card
- **Redirect:** `/order?package={packageId}&leadId={leadId}` ([page.tsx:254](app/packages/[leadId]/page.tsx#L254))

#### Step 3: Order Form
- **Page:** [app/order/page.tsx:8-42](app/order/page.tsx#L8)
- **Redirect:** Auto-redirects to `/order/coverage` ([page.tsx:14](app/order/page.tsx#L14))
- **Issue:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **FRICTION POINT** - Unnecessary redirect loop

### 2. Consumer Journey (Home Internet Variant)

**Entry Point:** [app/home-internet/page.tsx:13](app/home-internet/page.tsx#L13)

**Journey Steps:**

#### Step 1: Coverage Check & Browse
- Coverage hero with integrated checker
- Package grid with filtering
- Direct package selection

#### Step 2: Order Placement
- **Page:** [app/home-internet/order/page.tsx:12-72](app/home-internet/order/page.tsx#L12)
- **Components:**
  - Progress indicator (3 steps)
  - Order form (left column)
  - Order summary sidebar (sticky)
- **Better UX:** Single-page order form with clear progress

#### Step 3: Checkout
- **Page:** `app/home-internet/checkout/page.tsx`
- Payment and final confirmation

### 3. Business Customer Journey

**Current State:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR GAP IDENTIFIED**

**Service Types Available:**
- `BizFibreConnect` ([lib/types/products.ts:151](lib/types/products.ts#L151))
- IT Services, VoIP, Hosting, Security, Cloud Services

**Issues:**
1. **No dedicated business entry point** - Business customers use same coverage checker
2. **No business-specific package filtering** - All packages mixed together
3. **No B2B-focused messaging** - Same CTAs as consumer ("Get this deal")
4. **No lead qualification** - Business needs differ (SLA, support, scalability)

---

## Friction Points Analysis

### üî¥ Critical Friction Points

#### 1. Redirect Loop at Order Entry
**Location:** [app/order/page.tsx:14](app/order/page.tsx#L14)
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  router.push('/order/coverage');
}, [router]);
```
**Impact:**
- Unnecessary page load
- Poor perceived performance
- SEO issues (duplicate content)
- Confusing analytics

**Recommendation:** Remove `/order` page entirely or make it a direct order form

#### 2. Multiple Package Selection Flows
**Locations:**
- Generic: `/packages/{leadId}` ([app/packages/[leadId]/page.tsx:254](app/packages/[leadId]/page.tsx#L254))
- Home Internet: `/home-internet/order` ([app/home-internet/order/page.tsx:14](app/home-internet/order/page.tsx#L14))
- Wireless: `/wireless/order` ([app/wireless/order/page.tsx:14](app/wireless/order/page.tsx#L14))

**Impact:**
- Code duplication (~800 lines duplicated)
- Inconsistent user experience
- Difficult to maintain
- A/B testing challenges

**Recommendation:** Consolidate to single order flow with context-aware UI

#### 3. No Business Customer Differentiation
**Impact:**
- Lost enterprise leads
- Inappropriate messaging for B2B buyers
- No lead qualification
- Missing upsell opportunities (dedicated support, SLAs, etc.)

### üü° Moderate Friction Points

#### 4. Coverage Check Loading State
**Location:** [CoverageChecker.tsx:82-179](components/coverage/CoverageChecker.tsx#L82)
**Issue:**
- Multiple API calls in sequence (geocode ‚Üí lead ‚Üí coverage)
- Total latency: ~2-4 seconds
- No progress indication between stages

**Recommendation:**
- Add progress indicator: "Finding location ‚Üí Checking coverage ‚Üí Loading packages"
- Consider parallel processing where possible

#### 5. Package Card Selection Confusion
**Location:** [CoverageChecker.tsx:261-296](components/coverage/CoverageChecker.tsx#L261)
**Issue:**
- Packages shown but "Sign up now" button appears BELOW package grid
- Users must scroll down after selecting package
- Easy to miss the CTA

**Recommendation:**
- Floating "Continue" button when package selected
- Or inline "Select" button on each package card

#### 6. Lead Capture Without Context
**Location:** [CoverageChecker.tsx:108-122](components/coverage/CoverageChecker.tsx#L108)
**Issue:**
- Creates lead before knowing if coverage exists
- No lead qualification (residential vs business)
- No source tracking (which page/campaign)

**Recommendation:**
- Add customer type field
- Track UTM parameters
- Add optional phone number

### üü¢ Minor Friction Points

#### 7. Package Filtering Requires Tab Switch
**Location:** [app/packages/[leadId]/page.tsx:316-344](app/packages/[leadId]/page.tsx#L316)
**Issue:** Tabs hide packages by default
**Recommendation:** Show all with inline filters or category badges

#### 8. Missing Progress Indicator on Generic Order Flow
**Location:** [app/order/page.tsx:8](app/order/page.tsx#L8)
**Issue:** Home Internet and Wireless have progress bars, generic flow doesn't
**Recommendation:** Add consistent progress UI across all flows

## Journey Comparison: Consumer vs Business

| Aspect | Consumer Journey | Business Journey | Gap |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|-----|

| **Coverage Check** | ‚úÖ Works well | ‚ö†Ô∏è Same as consumer | Need company size/location fields |
| **Package Filtering** | ‚úÖ By technology type | ‚ùå Mixed with consumer | Need B2B-specific filters |
| **Messaging** | ‚úÖ Consumer-focused | ‚ùå Consumer messaging | Need ROI/uptime/SLA focus |
| **Lead Qualification** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic (address only) | ‚ùå No qualification | Need company details |
| **Quote Generation** | ‚ùå Not available | ‚ùå Not available | Critical for B2B |
| **Contact Sales** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Generic CTA | ‚ùå No dedicated option | Need account manager assignment |
| **Contract Terms** | ‚úÖ Month-to-month focus | ‚ùå Not highlighted | Need 12/24/36 month options |

- **Infrastructure:** Cloud-based Virtual Accelerator (scales automatically)
- **Training:** Partner with Replify for sales and support team training

#### 3. Package Naming Strategy

**Current Issues:**
- "Uncapped Shesha" ‚Üí Unclear what "Shesha" means
- "Wireless Plus" ‚Üí Generic, no emotional connection
- Package types mixed with product names

**Recommended Naming:**

**Consumer Residential:**
- **CircleTel Home Starter** (10-20 Mbps) - R249-R299
- **CircleTel Home Connect** (30-50 Mbps) - R399-R499
- **CircleTel Home Ultra** (100 Mbps) - R599-R699
- **CircleTel Home Extreme** (200 Mbps+) - R899-R1,199

**Consumer Work-From-Home:**
- **CircleTel Remote Starter** - R349
- **CircleTel Remote Pro** - R549
- **CircleTel Remote Ultra** (with VPN acceleration) - R749

**Business SME:**
- **CircleTel Business Basic** - R1,299
- **CircleTel Business Standard** (with SLA) - R1,899
- **CircleTel Business Premium** (with managed services) - R2,999

**Enterprise:**
- **CircleTel Enterprise Connect** (custom quote)
- **CircleTel Managed SD-WAN** (custom quote)

#### 4. Pricing Strategy by Customer Segment

| **Small Business** | R1,299-R2,999 | SLA, support, scalability | R1,899 (50 Mbps + SLA + Support) |
| **Enterprise** | R5,000-R50,000 | Custom SLA, managed services, multi-site | Custom quotes, starts R5,000 |

#### 10. Pricing Psychology Best Practices

**Display Pricing Strategy:**

‚ùå **Don't Do This:**
```
50 Mbps Uncapped
R399.00 per month
```

‚úÖ **Do This Instead:**
```
MOST POPULAR
50 Mbps Uncapped Home Internet
R399
per month

Save R200 vs competitors
[Get this deal ‚Üí]
```

**Price Comparison Tactics:**
- Always show "value" comparison: "Save R200/month vs Vodacom"
- Use strikethrough pricing: ~~R599~~ R399
- Highlight annual savings: "Save R2,400 per year"
- Show per-day cost: "Just R13 per day for unlimited internet"

**Tiered Pricing Visual Hierarchy:**
```
[Budget]          [POPULAR - highlighted]     [Premium]
Home Starter      Home Connect               Home Ultra
R249/month        R399/month                 R699/month
10 Mbps           50 Mbps                    100 Mbps
Basic support     Priority support           24/7 support
```

**Decoy Pricing Effect:**
- Offer 3 tiers where middle tier is "obvious best value"
- Make premium tier expensive enough that middle looks like a steal
- Example:
  - Basic: R249 (10 Mbps) ‚Üê Anchor low
  - Standard: R399 (50 Mbps) ‚Üê Most choose this (best value)
  - Premium: R899 (100 Mbps) ‚Üê Makes R399 feel cheap

#### 11. Revenue Optimization Model

**Current CircleTel Pricing (Wireless):**
- Average package price: R536.75 [(299+399+599+949)/4]
- No upsells, no add-ons, no premium tiers

**Optimized Pricing Model:**

**Base Package (50 Mbps):** R399/month
**Average Upsells per Customer:**
- 15% take static IP (+R99): R14.85 average
- 10% take WAN optimization (+R199): R19.90 average
- 5% take premium support (+R199): R9.95 average
- 20% choose 12-month (-10% but longer LTV): N/A for monthly calc
- **Effective ARPU: R443.70/customer (+11% revenue)**

**Business Customer Model:**
- Base package: R1,899/month
- Average add-ons: R300/month (static IPs, monitoring)
- **Business ARPU: R2,199/customer**

**Blended ARPU Target:**
- 80% residential: R443.70
- 20% business: R2,199
- **Blended: R794.96/customer**

**Revenue Projections (1,000 customers):**
- Old model: 1,000 √ó R399 = R399,000/month
- New model: 800 √ó R443.70 + 200 √ó R2,199 = R794,760/month
- **Revenue increase: +99% with same customer base**
