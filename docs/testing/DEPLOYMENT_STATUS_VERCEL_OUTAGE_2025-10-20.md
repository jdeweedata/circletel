# Deployment Status - Vercel IAD1 Outage Impact

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED - EXTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE**
**Priority**: HIGH - Bug fixes committed but not deployed
**Impact**: Users still experiencing Bug #1 and Bug #2 (0 packages displayed)

## Executive Summary

Three critical bugs were discovered and fixed in code, but **deployment to Vercel staging is blocked** by an ongoing Vercel IAD1 region partial outage. All bug fixes are committed to the main branch but not live on staging.

### Bug Status Summary

| Bug # | Issue | Code Status | Deployment Status | User Impact |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Bug #1** | Coordinates extraction from JSONB | ‚úÖ FIXED (commit 3d2355b) | ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED | 100% users affected |
| **Bug #2** | Query by wrong column | ‚úÖ FIXED (commit e9e6a58) | ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED | 100% users affected |
| **Bug #3** | Missing Vercel env vars | ‚úÖ FIXED (user action) | ‚úÖ DEPLOYED | Would be fixed once bugs 1&2 deploy |

## Current User Experience

### Coverage Check Flow Test (2025-10-20 10:00 UTC)
1. ‚úÖ **Homepage loads** - No issues
2. ‚úÖ **Address entry works** - Google Maps autocomplete functional
3. ‚úÖ **Coverage check submits** - Navigates to packages page
4. ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Packages page shows:
   - Tab: "All (0)"
   - Message: "No packages available at this time."
   - **ROOT CAUSE**: Bug #1 and Bug #2 still present in deployed code

### Screenshots
- `packages-page-zero-packages-full.png` - Full page showing 0 packages
- `packages-page-zero-packages-bug-not-fixed.png` - Viewport showing issue

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Aren't Bug Fixes Deployed?

**Commit Timeline vs. Outage Timeline**:
```
06:52 UTC - ‚úÖ Bug #1 fix committed (BEFORE outage)
07:12 UTC - ‚úÖ Bug #2 fix committed (BEFORE outage formally detected)
08:03 UTC - ‚ö†Ô∏è Vercel IAD1 outage begins
08:xx UTC - ‚ùå All deployments start failing
```

**Key Insight**: Bug fixes were committed shortly before or during early stages of the Vercel outage. All deployment attempts since then have failed due to Vercel infrastructure issues.

### Deployment Failure Patterns

1. **npm Registry 503 Errors** (early attempts):
   ```
   npm error 503 Service Unavailable - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/...
   ```
   **Fix Applied**: Created `.npmrc` with aggressive retry logic (commit be356cb)
   **Result**: npm install now succeeds, but deployment phase still fails

2. **Vercel Infrastructure Errors** (current state):
   ```
   Build Phase: ‚úÖ SUCCESS (npm install + compilation + page generation)
   Deployment Phase: ‚ùå FAILURE "An unexpected error happened when running this build"
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions Lint Failures** (ongoing):
   ```
   Multiple @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any errors
   Pre-existing code quality issues (not related to bug fixes)
   ```

## Bug Details (Committed but Not Deployed)

### Bug #1: Coordinates Extraction (FIXED in code, NOT deployed)

**File**: `app/api/coverage/packages/route.ts:44-54`

**Problem**: Accessing non-existent `lead.latitude` and `lead.longitude` properties

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (deployed - broken):
if (lead.latitude && lead.longitude) {
  const coordinates: Coordinates = {
    lat: lead.latitude,
    lng: lead.longitude
  };
}

// AFTER (committed - NOT deployed):
const lat = lead.coordinates?.lat;
const lng = lead.coordinates?.lng;

if (lat && lng) {
  const coordinates: Coordinates = {
    lat: lat,
    lng: lng
  };
}
```

**Commit**: `3d2355b` - "fix: correct coordinates extraction in packages API"
**Status**: ‚úÖ Committed to main | ‚ùå NOT deployed to staging

---

### Bug #2: Wrong Query Column (FIXED in code, NOT deployed)

**File**: `app/api/coverage/packages/route.ts:166-178`

**Problem**: Querying `product_category` instead of `service_type`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (deployed - broken):
const { data: packages } = await supabase
  .from('service_packages')
  .select('*')
  .in('product_category', productCategories)  // ‚ùå WRONG
  .eq('active', true);

// AFTER (committed - NOT deployed):
const { data: packages } = await supabase
  .from('service_packages')
  .select('*')
  .or(
    mappings && mappings.length > 0
      ? `product_category.in.(${productCategories.join(',')})`
      : `service_type.in.(${productCategories.join(',')})`
  )
  .eq('active', true);
```

**Commit**: `e9e6a58` - "fix: query packages by service_type when no mappings exist"
**Status**: ‚úÖ Committed to main | ‚ùå NOT deployed to staging

---

### Bug #3: Missing Environment Variables (FIXED on Vercel)

**Problem**: Missing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` on Vercel

**Fix Applied**: User manually added to Vercel dashboard:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://agyjovdugmtopasyvlng.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_jKBISiYlrRyJEfyYGcjJZw_AQJ8Udc7
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=sb_secret_KZlUVioFZ4r8vbeOK4215g_f3tUgyoG
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=3BVHkEN4AD4sQQRz
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Environment variables configured | ‚è≥ Waiting for deployment with code fixes

## Action Plan

### Immediate (Once Vercel Outage Resolves)

1. **Monitor Vercel Status** ‚è≥ WAITING
   - Check https://www.vercel-status.com for outage resolution
   - Current status: IAD1 region experiencing partial outage

2. **Trigger Fresh Deployment** ‚è≥ PENDING
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Push any small change to trigger auto-deploy
   git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger deployment after Vercel outage"
   git push origin main

   # Option 2: Use Vercel CLI
   vercel --prod --yes
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment Success** ‚è≥ PENDING
   - Check Vercel dashboard for successful build AND deployment
   - Ensure deployment includes commits: `3d2355b`, `e9e6a58`, `be356cb`

### Testing (After Successful Deployment)

4. **Test Coverage Check Flow** ‚è≥ PENDING
   ```
   - Navigate to https://circletel-staging.vercel.app/
   - Enter address: "18 Rasmus Erasmus, Heritage Hill, Centurion"
   - Click "Check coverage"
   - VERIFY: Packages page shows 14+ packages
   ```

5. **Verify Each Bug Fix** ‚è≥ PENDING
   - **Bug #1**: Coverage check completes (coordinates extracted)
   - **Bug #2**: Packages display correctly (query by service_type)
   - **Bug #3**: No 500 errors (environment variables present)

6. **Document Success** ‚è≥ PENDING
   - Take screenshots of working packages page
   - Update test reports
   - Close bug tickets

### Code Quality (Non-Blocking)

7. **Fix Lint Errors** üìã BACKLOG
   - Address pre-existing `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` warnings
   - Fix `react/no-unescaped-entities` errors
   - This is separate from bug fixes and can be done later

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **User Impact**: 100% of users cannot see packages (business impact)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **External Dependency**: Blocked by Vercel infrastructure (out of our control)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unknown Duration**: Outage resolution time uncertain

### Medium Risk
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deployment Backlog**: Multiple failed deployments may cause issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cache Invalidation**: Vercel may need cache clearing after outage

### Low Risk
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: All fixes reviewed and tested locally
- ‚úÖ **Git History**: Clean commit history, easy to rollback if needed
- ‚úÖ **Environment Config**: Variables configured correctly on Vercel

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. ‚úÖ **Systematic Bug Discovery**: Found all three bugs through methodical testing
2. ‚úÖ **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified exact issues and fixes for each bug
3. ‚úÖ **Clean Git History**: Separate commits for each bug fix
4. ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive bug reports created

### What Could Be Improved
1. ‚ùå **Deployment Verification**: Assumed deployments succeeded without testing
2. ‚ùå **Monitoring**: No alerts for "0 packages returned" scenarios
3. ‚ùå **CI/CD Hygiene**: Pre-existing lint errors causing confusion
4. ‚ùå **Environment Parity**: Local had env vars, Vercel didn't (Bug #3)

### Recommendations
1. **Add Deployment Health Checks**: Automated smoke tests post-deployment
2. **Monitor Business Metrics**: Alert when packages returned = 0
3. **Fix Lint Issues**: Clean up pre-existing code quality warnings
4. **Environment Sync**: Script to verify Vercel env vars match local
5. **Deployment Visibility**: Better tracking of which commit is live
6. **Alternative Platform**: Consider Netlify as backup (currently 99.99%+ uptime)
