# Epic: Order System Implementation

**Epic ID**: OSI-001
**Created**: September 27, 2025
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: High
**Sprint Target**: Sprint 43-44 (November 2025)

## Epic Overview

### Business Context
CircleTel needs a complete 4-stage order system to enable customers to self-order internet services online. This is critical for MVP launch and scaling customer acquisition beyond manual processes. The order system will reduce manual overhead, improve customer experience, and enable 24/7 order capture.

### Success Metrics
- **Business Impact**: 80% of orders self-service vs manual
- **Conversion Rate**: >60% completion rate from stage 1 to submission
- **Customer Experience**: <5 minutes average completion time
- **Revenue Operations**: Real-time order tracking and processing
- **Technical Performance**: <3s page load times, mobile-responsive

### Market Context
South African B2B and consumer customers expect:
- Instant coverage checking with accurate pricing
- Transparent pricing with VAT calculations
- Mobile-responsive ordering experience
- Secure payment processing
- Clear installation scheduling

## Technical Context

### Current State
```typescript
// Existing components available for reuse
/components/forms/           # Custom CircleTel form components
  /common/FormLayout.tsx     # Main layout with branding
  /common/FormSection.tsx    # Section wrapper component
  /common/FormFields.tsx     # Input, Select, Textarea fields

/components/layout/          # Navigation and layout
/components/ui/              # shadcn/ui base components
/lib/services/               # Supabase integration
```

### Target Architecture
```typescript
// New order system structure
/app/order/                  # Order flow pages
  /coverage/page.tsx         # Stage 1: Coverage check
  /account/page.tsx          # Stage 2: Account registration
  /contact/page.tsx          # Stage 3: Contact information
  /installation/page.tsx     # Stage 4: Installation & payment
  /confirmation/page.tsx     # Order confirmation

/components/order/           # Order-specific components
  /wizard/                   # Order wizard components
  /stages/                   # Individual stage components
  /forms/                    # Order form components

/lib/order/                  # Order business logic
  /types.ts                  # Order data types

- **Order Context**: React Context for cross-stage data sharing
- **Persistence**: Auto-save to localStorage and Supabase
- **Server State**: React Query for API calls and caching

### Validation Strategy
- **Client-Side**: Zod schemas for immediate feedback
- **Server-Side**: Duplicate validation on API endpoints
- **Progressive**: Validate as user progresses through stages
- **Graceful**: Clear error messages with recovery guidance

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Each stage loaded separately
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Image Optimization**: Optimized images for package displays
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor impact on overall bundle size

### Backend Performance
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries for order data
- **API Response Time**: <1s response time for form submissions
- **Caching**: Cache package and pricing data
- **Background Processing**: Heavy operations moved to background

## Integration Strategy

### Existing Systems
- **Form Components**: Use FormLayout, FormSection, FormFields
- **Authentication**: Integrate with Supabase Auth patterns
- **Database**: Extend current Supabase schema
- **Styling**: Maintain CircleTel design system

### New Integrations
- **Coverage API**: Integrate coverage checking service
- **Payment Gateway**: Add South African payment processing
- **Email Service**: Order confirmation and notifications
- **Analytics**: Track conversion and completion metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Architecture**: Review technical approach with team
2. **Create First Story**: Start with order wizard foundation
3. **Design Review**: UI/UX patterns for order stages
4. **Database Design**: Plan order schema extension
5. **API Design**: Define order management endpoints
