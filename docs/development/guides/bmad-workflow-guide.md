# BMAD Workflow Guide for CircleTel

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the BMAD METHOD within the CircleTel development workflow, combining structured planning with our existing development practices.

## BMAD Integration Philosophy

### Hybrid Approach
- **Preserve Existing**: Keep valuable business requirements and product documentation
- **Enhance with BMAD**: Add structured epic/story development
- **Context Engineering**: Rich implementation context in every story
- **Quality Gates**: Systematic quality assurance

### CircleTel-Specific Adaptations
- **6-Day Sprints**: BMAD stories sized for rapid iteration
- **Component Reuse**: Stories reference existing CircleTel components
- **Business Alignment**: Every story connects to business objectives
- **Technical Consistency**: Stories maintain established patterns

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Epic Planning

#### When to Create an Epic
- **Large Features**: Multiple stories, >5 days effort
- **Cross-Component Features**: Touches multiple areas of codebase
- **Business-Critical Features**: High impact on customer experience
- **Integration Projects**: External service integrations

#### Epic Planning Process
1. **Business Context** (Analyst Agent)
   - Review existing business requirements
   - Understand customer journey impact
   - Define success metrics

2. **Technical Architecture** (Architect Agent)
   - Design component structure
   - Plan integration patterns
   - Identify reusable components

3. **Story Breakdown** (Scrum Master Agent)
   - Break epic into implementable stories
   - Define story dependencies
   - Size stories for 6-day sprints

#### Epic Template
```markdown
# Epic: [Feature Name]

**Epic ID**: [XXX-001]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Sprint Target**: [Sprint Number]

## Business Context
- Customer impact
- Success metrics
- Market requirements

## Technical Context
- Current state
- Target architecture
- Integration points

## Story Breakdown
- Story 1: [Brief description] (X days)
- Story 2: [Brief description] (X days)
- ...

## Quality Gates
- Technical requirements
- Business requirements
- Security requirements
```

### Stage 2: Story Development

#### Story Creation Process
1. **Context Engineering**
   - Full business and technical context
   - Reference existing components
   - Define clear acceptance criteria

2. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Specific file paths and patterns
   - Code examples using CircleTel conventions
   - Integration with existing systems

3. **Quality Definition**
   - Testing requirements
   - Performance criteria
   - Security considerations

#### Story Template
```markdown
# Story: [Story Name]

**Story ID**: [XXX-001-01]
**Epic**: [Epic Name]
**Points**: [1-8]

## Context Engineering
### Current Architecture Context
[Existing code and patterns]

### Required Extensions
[What needs to be built]

### Integration Pattern
[How it fits with existing systems]

## Technical Implementation
[Detailed implementation steps]

## Acceptance Criteria
[Clear completion criteria]

## Definition of Done
[Quality checkpoints]
```

#### Story Development Workflow
```

```

### Stage 3: Quality Assurance

#### Quality Gate Types
1. **Story Gates**: Individual story completion
2. **Epic Gates**: Feature completion
3. **Sprint Gates**: Sprint readiness
4. **Release Gates**: Production readiness

#### Quality Gate Process
1. **Automated Checks**
   - TypeScript compilation
   - ESLint compliance
   - Build success

2. **Manual Validation**
   - User journey testing
   - Business requirement verification
   - Integration testing

3. **Review Process**
   - Code review
   - Business review
   - Security review

- **Performance Testing**: Load and performance validation
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment

## CircleTel-Specific Patterns

### Component Integration
```typescript
// Stories should reference existing patterns
import { FormLayout } from '@/components/forms/common/FormLayout';
import { useZohoMCP } from '@/hooks/use-zoho-mcp';

// Follow established CircleTel conventions
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Use existing patterns
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['feature-data'],
  queryFn: fetchFeatureData,
});
```

### Styling Consistency
```typescript
// Follow CircleTel design system
className="bg-circleTel-orange text-circleTel-white"
```

## File Organization
