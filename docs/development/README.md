# CircleTel Development Documentation (Enhanced with BMAD METHOD)

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive development documentation for the CircleTel project, now enhanced with BMAD METHOD for structured feature development and quality assurance.

## Hybrid Structure

We've integrated BMAD METHOD while preserving valuable existing documentation:

```
📁 development/
├── 📁 architecture/     # System architecture (existing + enhanced)
├── 📁 features/        # Feature specifications (existing)
├── 📁 guides/          # Development workflow and setup guides (existing)
├── 📁 standards/       # Coding standards (existing)
├── 📁 epics/           # 🆕 BMAD: High-level feature groupings
├── 📁 stories/         # 🆕 BMAD: Detailed implementation stories
└── 📁 qa/              # 🆕 BMAD: Quality gates and assessments
    ├── 📁 assessments/ # Feature completion assessments
    └── 📁 gates/       # Quality checkpoints
```

## BMAD METHOD Integration

### Epic-Driven Development
- **Epics**: Large features broken into manageable parts
- **Stories**: Context-rich implementation details
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checkpoints for quality assurance

### Agent-Assisted Planning
- **Analyst**: Business requirements and user journey analysis
- **Architect**: Technical architecture and patterns
- **Scrum Master**: Feature breakdown and story creation
- **Developer**: Implementation guidance
- **QA**: Quality assurance and testing

## Getting Started

### For New Developers
1. Read the [Setup Guide](guides/setup-guide.md)
2. Review the [Architecture Overview](architecture/system-overview.md)
3. Follow the [Coding Standards](standards/coding-standards.md)
4. Understand the [BMAD Workflow](#bmad-workflow)

### For Feature Development
1. Check existing [Epics](epics/) for your feature area
2. Review related [Stories](stories/) for implementation context
3. Follow quality gates in [QA](qa/) directory
4. Use established CircleTel patterns and components

## BMAD Workflow

### 1. Epic Planning
```
Create epic → Define scope → Break into stories
```

### 2. Story Development
```
Story context → Implementation → Quality check
```

### 3. Quality Assurance
```
Assessment → Gates → Deployment readiness
```

## Key Documents

### Architecture (Enhanced)
- **[System Overview](architecture/system-overview.md)**: Next.js + Supabase + BMAD patterns
- **[Database Schema](architecture/database-schema.md)**: Current schema + planned extensions
- **[Component Architecture](architecture/component-architecture.md)**: Existing + new patterns

### Development (BMAD-Enhanced)
- **[BMAD Workflow Guide](guides/bmad-workflow-guide.md)**: How to use BMAD for features
- **[Story Writing Guide](guides/story-writing-guide.md)**: Creating context-rich stories
- **[Quality Gates Guide](guides/quality-gates-guide.md)**: QA checkpoints

### Standards (Aligned with BMAD)
- **[Coding Standards](standards/coding-standards.md)**: TypeScript + React + BMAD patterns
- **[Story Standards](standards/story-standards.md)**: 🆕 Story format and context requirements
- **[Quality Standards](standards/quality-standards.md)**: 🆕 BMAD quality checkpoints

## Current Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement 🔄
- ✅ **BMAD Integration**: Core structure in place
- 🟡 **Authentication**: Replace mock auth with Supabase
- 🟡 **Zoho Billing**: Add billing module to existing MCP integration

### Phase 2: Feature Development 📋
- 🔲 **Order System Epic**: 4-stage wizard using existing components
- 🔲 **Admin Dashboard Epic**: Enhanced management capabilities
- 🔲 **Customer Portal Epic**: Self-service functionality

### Phase 3: Quality & Scale 🎯
- 🔲 **Performance Epic**: Optimization and caching
- 🔲 **Testing Epic**: Comprehensive test coverage
- 🔲 **Mobile Epic**: PWA enhancements

## BMAD METHOD Benefits

### Context Engineering
- Stories contain full implementation context
- Reduces "what was I building?" moments
- Preserves architectural decisions

### Quality Assurance
- Built-in quality gates
- Systematic feature completion
- Consistent code quality

### Team Alignment
- Clear handoffs between planning and development
- Shared understanding of feature scope
- Reduced context loss during sprints

## Next Steps

1. **Create First Epic**: Zoho Billing Integration
2. **Generate Stories**: Use BMAD Scrum Master to break down features
3. **Implement with Context**: Use story details for guided development
4. **Quality Gates**: Follow systematic QA checkpoints
