### Development Approach
- **Build on existing**: Use current CircleTel components and styling
- **Leverage Supabase**: Build on existing database and auth setup
- **Maintain consistency**: Keep existing branding and user experience
- **Gradual enhancement**: Add features incrementally using proven patterns

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Use Existing)
- ✅ **Database**: Extend current Supabase schema
- ✅ **Components**: Use existing form components and layouts
- ✅ **Authentication**: Implement Supabase Auth
- ✅ **Styling**: Maintain current CircleTel branding

### Phase 2: Order System (Build New)
- 🟡 **Coverage & Pricing**: Use existing coverage components
- 🟡 **Account Registration**: Implement using existing form patterns
- 🟡 **Contact Information**: Use existing form fields
- 🟡 **Installation & Payment**: Add order-specific components

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Future)
- ⭕ **Advanced Features**: Add as needed based on user feedback
- ⭕ **Performance Optimization**: Optimize existing implementation
- ⭕ **Mobile App**: Consider native mobile experience
- ⭕ **Analytics**: Add business intelligence features
