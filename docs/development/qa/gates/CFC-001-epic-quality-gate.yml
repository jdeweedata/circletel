notes: |
  Epic assessment completed. Current implementation is 80% complete and meets
  most business requirements. Critical gaps identified:
  1. Payment integration (CFC-001-01) - Blocks revenue
  2. Order summary enhancement (CFC-001-02) - UX improvement
  3. CRM notification UI (CFC-001-03) - User reassurance

  Recommendation: Prioritize CFC-001-01 (payment) for immediate sprint.
  Current coverage check system is production-ready and performing well.
