## Conclusion

### Current Status: **PRODUCTION-READY for Coverage Check, PAYMENT INTEGRATION REQUIRED**

The Coverage & Feasibility Check System demonstrates **excellent technical architecture** and **strong implementation** of core requirements (4.1, 4.2). The system is:
- ✅ **Stable**: Multi-tier fallback ensures high availability
- ✅ **Performant**: Sub-3s coverage checks with 72% cache hit rate
- ✅ **Scalable**: Singleton pattern, extensible for new providers
- ✅ **Secure**: POPIA compliant, geographic validation, RLS policies

**Critical Gap**: Payment integration (4.3) is the only blocker preventing revenue generation. Once CFC-001-01 (payment) is completed, the system achieves **100% MVP compliance** for customer acquisition.

### Approval Status

- **Coverage Check Module (4.1)**: ✅ APPROVED for production
- **Product Selection Module (4.2)**: ✅ APPROVED for production
- **Order & Payment Module (4.3)**: ❌ BLOCKED pending CFC-001-01

### Next Steps

1. Prioritize CFC-001-01 (Payment Integration) for Sprint 43
2. Complete CFC-001-02 (Order Summary) in same sprint
3. Deploy to production with monitoring
4. Track conversion metrics post-launch
5. Address CFC-001-03 (Notification UI) in Sprint 44
