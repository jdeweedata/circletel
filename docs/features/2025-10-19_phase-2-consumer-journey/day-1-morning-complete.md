# Phase 2 Day 1 Morning - Complete ✅

## Summary
Enhanced the coverage checker with complete lead capture functionality for no-coverage scenarios.

## What Was Built

### 1. NoCoverageLeadForm Component
**File**: `components/coverage/NoCoverageLeadForm.tsx`

**Features**:
- Dynamic form fields based on customer type (Consumer/SMME/Enterprise)
- Conditional company name field for business customers

- Updates lead with Zoho ID after sync
- Sends confirmation email (async, non-blocking)
- Returns minimal response for quick user feedback

**Request Body**:
```typescript
{
  customer_type: 'consumer' | 'smme' | 'enterprise',
  first_name: string,
  last_name: string,
  email: string,
  phone: string,
  company_name?: string,
  address: string,
  coordinates?: { lat: number, lng: number },
  service_interest?: string,
  // ... additional optional fields
}
```

**Response**:
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  lead: {
    id: string,
    first_name: string,
    last_name: string,
    email: string,
    status: string
  },
  message: string
}
```

### 3. useLeadCapture Hook
**File**: `hooks/useLeadCapture.ts`

**Features**:
- Centralized lead submission logic
- Loading state management
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

- TypeScript type safety

**Hook Interface**:
```typescript
{
  captureLead: (data: CreateCoverageLeadInput) => Promise<LeadCaptureResult>,
  isSubmitting: boolean,
  error: string | null
}
```

### 4. Coverage Page Integration
**File**: `app/coverage/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `no-coverage` step to coverage check flow
- Integrated NoCoverageLeadForm component
- Added state for no-coverage coordinates
- Modified coverage check handlers to show lead form instead of alert
- Updated UI flow: `input` → `checking` → `results` OR `no-coverage`

### 5. Email Template
**File**: `lib/notifications/notification-service.ts`

**New Template**: `no_coverage_lead_confirmation`

**Features**:
- Branded CircleTel email design

- "What happens next" section
- Alternative wireless solutions link
- Contact information and support details

**Template Variables**:
```typescript
{
  customer_name: string,
  address: string,
  estimated_timeline?: string,
  lead_id: string
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Happy Path (No Coverage):
1. User enters address and clicks "Show me my options"
2. Coverage check runs → No coverage found
3. User sees "No Coverage - Lead Capture Form"
4. User fills out form with details
5. User clicks "Notify Me"
6. Form submits → Success message shown
7. User sees "You're on the list!" confirmation
8. User receives email confirmation (async)
9. Lead synced to Zoho CRM (async)
10. After 2 seconds, form resets to allow another check

### Backend Process:
1. Lead saved to `coverage_leads` table
2. Lead sync to Zoho CRM (async, non-blocking)
3. Zoho ID updated in database
4. Confirmation email sent (async, non-blocking)
5. Admin notification (optional, can be added)

## Database Records Created

When a lead is captured, a new record is created in `coverage_leads` with:
- All customer contact information
- Address and coordinates
- Customer type and company name (if business)
- Lead source = `coverage_checker`
- Status = `new`
- Service interest notes
- Metadata (can include UTM params, referrer, etc.)

## Integration Points

### Zoho CRM Sync
- Function: `createZohoLead()` from `lib/zoho/lead-capture.ts`
- Runs asynchronously to avoid blocking API response
- Maps CircleTel lead fields to Zoho Lead object
- Updates lead record with Zoho ID after successful sync

### Email Notifications
- Service: `EmailNotificationService.send()`
- Template: `no_coverage_lead_confirmation`
- Provider: Resend API
- Runs asynchronously to avoid blocking API response
