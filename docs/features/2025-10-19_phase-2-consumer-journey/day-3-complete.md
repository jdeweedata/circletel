## Responsive Design

### Desktop (1024px+):
- Full statistics dashboard (5 cards in row)
- 4-column filter grid
- Full-width table with all columns
- Sidebar layout for order tracking page

### Tablet (768px - 1023px):
- Statistics cards in 2-3 column grid

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML with proper headings
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support

## Performance Optimizations
