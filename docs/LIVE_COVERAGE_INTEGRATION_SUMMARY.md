---

## üéØ What Was Discovered

### MTN Coverage Architecture (from test-fish-eagle analysis)

1. **WMS Protocol** - Not a simple REST API
   - Endpoint: `https://mtnsi.mtn.co.za/cache/geoserver/wms`
   - Method: `GetFeatureInfo` (WMS 1.3.0)
   - Projection: EPSG:900913 (Spherical Mercator)

2. **Multi-Layer Coverage System**
   - `mtnsi:MTNSA-Coverage-5G` - 5G coverage
   - `mtnsi:MTNSA-Coverage-LTE` - LTE/4G coverage
   - `mtnsi:MTNSA-Coverage-3G` - 3G coverage
   - `mtnsi:GigZone-POI` - GigZone hotspots

3. **Visual Coverage Quality** (from screenshots)
   - üî¥ **Fixed LTE**: Most extensive (red overlay - 100% coverage)
   - üü¶ **Uncapped Wireless**: Strong (teal overlay - 90%+ coverage)
   - üîµ **Licensed Wireless**: Good with gaps (blue overlay - 80%+)
   - üü¢ **Fibre**: Limited/patchy (green overlay)

4. **Coordinate-Based Lookup Flow**
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ

#### 1. Coordinate Conversion Utilities
**File:** [lib/coverage/mtn/coordinate-converter.ts](../lib/coverage/mtn/coordinate-converter.ts)

**Features:**
- EPSG:900913 (Spherical Mercator) projection conversion
- WGS84 to/from Spherical Mercator transformations
- Bounding box creation for WMS requests
- South Africa geographic validation
- Distance calculation (Haversine formula)
- Polygon center calculation

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
toSphericalMercator(lat, lng) ‚Üí { x, y }
createBoundingBox(lat, lng, radiusMeters) ‚Üí BoundingBox
isInSouthAfrica(lat, lng) ‚Üí boolean
calculateDistance(coord1, coord2) ‚Üí meters
```

#### 2. Viewport & Pixel Calculator
**File:** [lib/coverage/mtn/viewport-calculator.ts](../lib/coverage/mtn/viewport-calculator.ts)

**Features:**
- Map viewport calculation from center point and zoom
- Pixel-to-coordinate conversion (MTN's exact implementation)
- World coordinate system handling
- Optimal zoom level calculation
- Ground resolution calculation

**Key Methods:**
```typescript

latLngToPixel(lat, lng, viewport) ‚Üí PixelCoordinates
createGetFeatureInfoContext(lat, lng, zoom) ‚Üí CompleteContext
calculateOptimalZoom(accuracyRadiusMeters) ‚Üí zoomLevel
```

**Based on MTN's Logic:**
```javascript
// From maptools-wmsquery.js analysis
const scale = Math.pow(2, zoom);
const pixelX = Math.floor((worldCoordinate.x - worldCoordinateNW.x) * scale);
const pixelY = Math.floor((worldCoordinate.y - worldCoordinateNW.y) * scale);
```

#### 3. Enhanced WMS Client
**File:** [lib/coverage/mtn/wms-client.ts](../lib/coverage/mtn/wms-client.ts)

**New Features:**

- Available technologies list with recommendations

**Request:**
```typescript
POST /api/coverage/mtn/check
{
  "address": "25 Fish Eagle Place, Cape Town",
  "includeProductRecommendations": true
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "services": [...],
    "coverageQualities": [
      {
        "technology": "fixed_lte",
        "available": true,

## üîç How It Works

### Coverage Check Flow

```
1. User enters address
   ‚Üì
2. Address geocoded to lat/lng (Google Maps API)
   ‚Üì
3. Coordinates validated for South Africa
   ‚Üì
4. Viewport calculated for WMS query
   ‚Üì
5. Pixel coordinates computed
   ‚Üì
6. WMS GetFeatureInfo request sent
   ‚Üì
7. Coverage results parsed and normalized
   ‚Üì
8. Coverage quality analyzed
   ‚Üì
9. Products matched to available technologies
   ‚Üì
10. Recommendations scored and sorted
   ‚Üì
11. Display available packages with coverage badges
```

### Product Matching Logic

```typescript
// For each product:
1. Find matching coverage quality (by technology)
2. Check if coverage is available
3. Calculate product score (0-100)
4. Determine confidence level (high/medium/low)
5. Generate recommendation reason
6. Sort by score (highest first)
7. Display top N recommendations
```

### Coverage Quality Determination

**From WMS Response:**
```typescript
Signal Strength ‚Üí Visual Coverage
- excellent/good ‚Üí "excellent" coverage
- fair ‚Üí "limited" coverage
- poor/none ‚Üí "no coverage"

Technology ‚Üí Priority
- Fixed LTE ‚Üí Most extensive (100% coverage area)
- 5G ‚Üí High speed, good coverage
- LTE ‚Üí Good coverage (90%+)
- Fibre ‚Üí Limited infrastructure (patchy)
```
