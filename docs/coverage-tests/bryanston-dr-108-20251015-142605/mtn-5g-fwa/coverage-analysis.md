2. **"Check a different address"** - Start over with a new address

---

## Technical Observations

### Test Execution Flow

The Playwright MCP automation successfully completed the following steps:

1. ✅ **Navigation**: Successfully loaded MTN 5G FWA landing page
   - URL: `https://www.mtn.co.za/shop/deals/plans/data-only/uncapped-home-internet`
   - Page loaded without connectivity issues

2. ✅ **Address Input**: Successfully filled the search textbox
   - Input field identified: `getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Search' })`
   - Full address entered: "108 Bryanston Dr, Bryanston, Sandton, 2191, South Africa"

3. ✅ **Autocomplete Selection**: Successfully clicked the suggested address
   - Google Places Autocomplete dropdown appeared
   - Exact match found and selected
   - Address format: "108 Bryanston Dr, Bryanston, Sandton, 2191, South Africa"

4. ❌ **Coverage Verification**: System error occurred during backend processing
   - Error modal displayed instead of coverage results
   - No packages or coverage information returned
   - System presented retry options

### Website Behavior Analysis

**Expected Behavior**:
- After address selection, the system should query MTN's coverage database
- Return either:
  - ✅ Positive coverage result with available packages and pricing
  - ❌ Negative coverage result with "no coverage" message
  - ⚠️ Partial coverage result with limited package options

**Actual Behavior**:
- System encountered an error during the coverage lookup process
- Generic error modal displayed: "Let's try that again."
- No specific error details, error codes, or technical information provided
- Address was correctly received (as evidenced by echo-back in modal)

**Possible Technical Causes**:
1. **Backend API Timeout**: Coverage database query exceeded timeout threshold
2. **Database Connection Issue**: Temporary connectivity problem with MTN's coverage database
3. **Address Parsing Error**: Backend system failed to geocode the address despite frontend recognition
4. **Rate Limiting**: Automated testing may have triggered anti-bot protection or rate limiting
5. **Service Degradation**: Temporary outage or maintenance on MTN's coverage verification service
6. **Data Validation Failure**: Backend rejected the address format despite Google Places validation
7. **Session/CSRF Token Issue**: Authentication or session token validation failed on backend

### User Experience Issues

**Usability Concerns**:
- ❌ **Vague Error Message**: "Let's try that again." provides no actionable information
- ❌ **No Error Code**: No reference number or technical identifier for troubleshooting
- ❌ **No Guidance**: No explanation of what went wrong or how to resolve it
- ❌ **No Status Information**: No indication if this is a temporary or permanent issue
- ⚠️ **User Frustration Risk**: Users may repeatedly encounter the same error without understanding why

**What Would Improve UX**:
- Specific error messages (e.g., "Coverage database temporarily unavailable")
- Error codes for support reference
- Estimated time for retry if system issue
- Alternative contact methods (phone, chat) if online check fails
- Status page link showing system availability

---

## Error Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: Backend API Timeout (Probability: 40%)

**Evidence**:
- Address was correctly received by frontend
- Google Places Autocomplete worked correctly
- Error occurred during backend processing phase
- Generic error message suggests unexpected failure

**Implications**:
- MTN's coverage database query may be slow or overloaded
- Retrying might work if temporary timeout
- Issue may be intermittent rather than systematic

**Testing Approach**:
- Retry the same address 2-3 times with 30-second delays
- Test with a known-covered address (e.g., Sandton City Mall)
- Compare response times across different addresses

---

### Hypothesis 2: Anti-Bot Protection / Rate Limiting (Probability: 30%)

**Evidence**:
- Test conducted via automated Playwright browser
- MTN may have security measures against automated queries
- Error provides no technical details (security feature)
- Manual testing might yield different results

**Implications**:
- Automated testing of MTN platform may be unreliable
- Human verification (CAPTCHA) may be required
- API integration would be better than web scraping approach

**Testing Approach**:
- Retry manually in a regular browser (non-automated)
- Check for CAPTCHA or verification challenges
- Contact MTN about API access for coverage checking
- Implement delays between automated requests

---

### Hypothesis 3: Address Geocoding Failure (Probability: 20%)

**Evidence**:
- Bryanston is a well-established Sandton suburb
- Address exists in Google Places database
- MTN's backend geocoding may differ from Google's

**Implications**:
- MTN may use different geocoding service (not Google)
- Specific address formats may be required
- Suburb or area-level checking may work better than precise addresses

**Testing Approach**:
- Test with just "Bryanston, Sandton" (area-level)
- Test with alternative address formats
- Compare results with nearby addresses
- Test with well-known landmarks in Bryanston

---

### Hypothesis 4: Service Degradation / Maintenance (Probability: 10%)

**Evidence**:
- Single test execution (no retry attempted yet)
- No maintenance banner observed on website
- Error message suggests temporary issue ("try again")

**Implications**:
- Issue may resolve itself shortly
- Other users may be experiencing same problem
- Not specific to this address or test method

**Testing Approach**:
- Check MTN's status page or social media for outage reports
- Retry after 30 minutes
- Test multiple different addresses to confirm systemic issue
- Contact MTN support to verify system availability

---
