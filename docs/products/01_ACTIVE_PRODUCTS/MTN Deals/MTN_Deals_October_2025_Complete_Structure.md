## 9. Database Schema for Supabase Implementation

### 9.1 Recommended Table Structure

Based on analysis, here's the optimised categorisation structure for the Supabase database:

```sql
-- Add categorisation columns to mtn_deals table
ALTER TABLE public.mtn_deals ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS commission_tier TEXT;

ALTER TABLE public.mtn_deals ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS has_priceplan_freebie BOOLEAN;
ALTER TABLE public.mtn_deals ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sales_priority INTEGER;

-- Create indexes for categorisation
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_deals_commission_tier ON public.mtn_deals(commission_tier);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_deals_manufacturer ON public.mtn_deals(manufacturer);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_deals_sellable ON public.mtn_deals(is_sellable) WHERE is_sellable = true;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_deals_priority ON public.mtn_deals(sales_priority DESC);

3. **Leverage Device Freebies:** 56.1% of deals include device freebies - strong selling point
