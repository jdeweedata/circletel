---

## 2. MTN Commission Rate Structure

### 2.1 Tiered Commission Rates

As per the agreement (Addendum A, Section 2), MTN's commission structure is tiered based on monthly subscription value:

| Monthly Subscription Range | MTN Commission Rate | CircleTel Share (30%) | Contract Term |
|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **R0 - R99.99** | 4.75% | 1.425% | 24 months |
| **R100 - R199.99** | 5.75% | 1.725% | 24 months |
| **R200 - R299.99** | 7.25% | 2.175% | 24 months |
| **R300 - R499.99** | 8.75% | 2.625% | 24 months |
| **R500 - R999.99** | 9.75% | 2.925% | 24 months |
| **R1,000 - R1,999.99** | 11.75% | 3.525% | 24 months |
| **R2,000+** | 13.75% | 4.125% | 24 months |

### 2.2 Commission Calculation Method

**Important:** Commissions are calculated on the **total contract value**, not monthly recurring charges.

**Formula:**
```
Total Contract Value = Monthly Subscription × Contract Term (months)
MTN Commission = Total Contract Value × MTN Commission Rate
CircleTel Commission = MTN Commission × 30%
```

## 3. Worked Examples

### Example 1: Entry-Level Package (from Agreement)

**Given in Addendum A, Section 2:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Monthly Subscription | R500 |

| Applicable Tier | R500 - R999.99 |
| MTN Commission Rate | 9.75% |
| MTN Commission Amount | R1,170 |

| MTN Commission Rate | 13.75% |
| MTN Commission Amount | R8,250 |
| **CircleTel Share (30%)** | **R2,475** (excl. VAT) |

| MTN Commission Rate | 5.75% |
| MTN Commission Amount | R207 |
| **CircleTel Share (30%)** | **R62.10** (excl. VAT) |

**With VAT:**

---

## 4. Renewals and Lifetime Value

### 4.1 Renewal Commission Structure

**Critical Clause (Addendum A, Section 3.1):**
> "Circle Tel shall continue to receive 30% commission on all Customer renewals, upgrades and migrations **without time limitation**."

**This means:**
- Commission continues beyond initial 24-month contract
- Applies to contract renewals
- Applies to package upgrades
- Applies to service migrations
- **No expiry date** on commission entitlement

### 4.2 Customer Retention Rights

**Clause 3.2:**
> "Customers remain attributed to Circle Tel for commission purposes **regardless of renewal cycles**."

**Implications:**
- Customer "ownership" remains with CircleTel permanently
- Even if customer renews direct with MTN/Arlan, CircleTel still receives commission
- Strong lifetime value protection
- No transfer of customer attribution

---

### 4.3 Lifetime Value Calculation

**Example: R500/month Package**

| Year | Monthly Sub | Annual Revenue | MTN Commission (9.75%) | CircleTel (30%) | CircleTel (incl. VAT) |
|------|------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Year 1** | R500 | R6,000 | R585 | R175.50 | R201.83 |
| **Year 2** | R500 | R6,000 | R585 | R175.50 | R201.83 |
| **Year 3** | R500 | R6,000 | R585 | R175.50 | R201.83 |
| **Year 4** | R500 | R6,000 | R585 | R175.50 | R201.83 |
| **Year 5** | R500 | R6,000 | R585 | R175.50 | R201.83 |
| **5-Year Total** | | **R30,000** | **R2,925** | **R877.50** | **R1,009.13** |

**Key Point:** A single R500/month customer generates **R1,009 in commission** over 5 years, assuming no upgrades.

## 6. Commission on MTN Deals Database

### 6.1 Applying Commission Structure to Deals

Based on the October 2025 MTN Deals file provided, here are commission calculations for sample deals:

#### Deal: 202508EBU2726 - Oppo Reno 14 5G

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Total Subscription Incl VAT** | R849.00 |
| **Total Subscription Excl VAT** | R738.26 |
| **Contract Term** | 36 months |
| **Applicable Tier** | R500 - R999.99 |
| **MTN Commission Rate** | 9.75% |

**Commission Calculation:**
```
Total Contract Value (excl VAT) = R738.26 × 36 = R26,577.36
MTN Commission (9.75%) = R26,577.36 × 0.0975 = R2,591.29
CircleTel Share (30%) = R2,591.29 × 0.30 = R777.39 (excl VAT)
CircleTel Share (incl VAT) = R777.39 × 1.15 = R893.99
```

**Monthly Equivalent:**
- CircleTel earns R777.39 ÷ 36 = **R21.59/month** over contract life

---

#### Deal: 202508EBU2727 - Oppo Reno 14 5G (Higher Tier)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Total Subscription Incl VAT** | R909.00 |

| **Contract Term** | 36 months |
| **Applicable Tier** | R500 - R999.99 |
| **MTN Commission Rate** | 9.75% |

**Commission Calculation:**
```
Total Contract Value (excl VAT) = R790.43 × 36 = R28,455.48
MTN Commission (9.75%) = R28,455.48 × 0.0975 = R2,774.41
CircleTel Share (30%) = R2,774.41 × 0.30 = R832.32 (excl VAT)
CircleTel Share (incl VAT) = R832.32 × 1.15 = R957.17
```

---

#### Deal: 202509EBU1426 - Apple iPhone 17 (256GB)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Total Subscription Incl VAT** | R899.00 |

| **Contract Term** | 36 months |
| **Applicable Tier** | R500 - R999.99 |
| **MTN Commission Rate** | 9.75% |

**Commission Calculation:**
```
Total Contract Value (excl VAT) = R781.74 × 36 = R28,142.64
MTN Commission (9.75%) = R28,142.64 × 0.0975 = R2,743.91
CircleTel Share (30%) = R2,743.91 × 0.30 = R823.17 (excl VAT)
CircleTel Share (incl VAT) = R823.17 × 1.15 = R946.65
