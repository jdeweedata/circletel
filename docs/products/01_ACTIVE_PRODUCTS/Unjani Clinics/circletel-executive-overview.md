## 3. PHASED IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### 3.1 Phase 1: Base Model Validation (Months 1-3)

```
PHASE 1 - TEST CORE CONNECTIVITY:
=================================

Investment: R291,130 (5 pilot sites)

What We Test:
├── Basic clinic connectivity only
├── ThinkWiFi integration
├── Technical reliability
├── NO community vouchers yet
└── Focus: Prove foundation

Infrastructure (Minimal):
├── Basic mounting: R2,000 × 5 = R10,000
├── Basic router: R3,000 × 5 = R15,000
├── 2 WiFi APs only: R3,200 × 5 = R16,000
├── Installation: R5,000 × 5 = R25,000
└── Total Phase 1 CapEx: R66,000

Monthly Revenue (Base Only):
├── Unjani base fee: R450 × 5 = R2,250
├── ThinkWiFi base: R400 × 5 = R2,000
├── Basic ad revenue: R200 × 5 = R1,000
└── Total: R5,250

Success Metrics:
✓ Technical uptime >99%
✓ Clinic satisfaction >90%
✓ ThinkWiFi metrics achieved
✓ Break-even achieved

Decision Gate: Proceed to Phase 2 if base model stable
```

### 3.2 Phase 2: Add Community Services (Months 4-6)

```

├── Upgrade routers: R5,000 × 5 = R25,000
├── BSS/OSS setup: R5,000 × 5 = R25,000
├── Add 10 new sites: R45,000 × 10 = R450,000
└── Total Phase 2 CapEx: R572,000

Monthly Revenue (With Vouchers):
├── Base revenue: R1,200 × 15 = R18,000
├── Voucher sales (30/day): R3,825 × 15 = R57,375

## 13. CONCLUSION & EXECUTIVE DECISION

### 13.1 Conservative Investment Thesis

**The Prudent Approach:**

With conservative assumptions (30 vouchers/day vs 50, 25% adoption vs 50%) and proven geographic coverage across 94 Tarana-enabled sites, the business case delivers:
- **26.0% EBITDA margins** (improved with no power costs)
- **20-month payback** (within acceptable range)
- **510% 5-year ROI** (strong returns even conservatively)
- **Phased validation** (test base model first)

### 13.2 Risk-Weighted Recommendation

```
EXECUTIVE DECISION FRAMEWORK:
============================

Investment Approach: PHASED DEPLOYMENT
├── Phase 1: R291K (base model only)
├── Phase 2: R582K (add vouchers)
├── Phase 3: R4.6M (scale to 94 sites)
└── Total: R5.47M over 12 months

Conservative Year 2 Profit: R3.31M
Geographic Coverage: 94 Tarana-enabled sites
Risk Level: LOW (phased approach)
Recommendation: PROCEED WITH PHASE 1 IMMEDIATELY

Rationale:
1. Minimal initial capital (R291K)
2. Test base model before vouchers
3. Power costs covered by clinics
4. 94 sites confirmed with Tarana
5. Each phase validates next step
6. Exit options at each gate

Phase Gates:
Phase 1 → 2: Base model working, clinics satisfied
Phase 2 → 3: 30+ vouchers/day achieved
Phase 3: Scale only if margins >25%
```

### 13.3 Final Executive Summary

**The Bottom Line:**

CircleTel has a clear path to profitability through a phased approach across **94 Tarana-enabled clinics**:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Test base model
- Investment: R291K
- No vouchers yet - just clinic connectivity
- Validate technical model and partnerships
- Exit option if not viable

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Add community services
- Additional: R582K
- Implement voucher system
- Test community adoption
- Validate 30 vouchers/day assumption

**Phase 3 (Months 7-12):** Scale to 94 sites
- Additional: R4.6M
- Full deployment across provinces
- Achieve R276K monthly profit
- 37.5% margins with power covered by clinics

**Key Advantages:**
- **Power costs eliminated** (clinics provide)
- **94 sites confirmed** with Tarana feasibility
- **Phased risk mitigation** (test before scale)
- **Sales & marketing model** (15% cost vs fixed spaza fees)

Even with conservative assumptions:
- Only 30 vouchers/day (vs 50 optimistic)
- 25% community adoption (vs 50% optimistic)
- 5% technical downtime allowance
- 20% competitive price pressure

The model delivers **26% EBITDA margins** and **R3.31M annual profit** by Year 2.

**Executive Recommendation: PROCEED WITH PHASE 1**
- Start with R291K investment
- Test base model for 3 months
- Add vouchers only if base stable
- Scale only after proving voucher adoption
- Maintain exit options at each phase

This phased approach minimizes risk while validating each component of the business model before committing significant capital.
