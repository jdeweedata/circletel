## Slide 7: Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Critical Risks Identified

**1. Community Adoption**
- **Risk:** <30 vouchers/day
- **Mitigation:** Free trials, education
- **Fallback:** Scale down deployment

**2. Technical/Operations**
- **Risk:** Network failures, support costs
- **Mitigation:** 5% spares, 4hr SLA, automation
- **Fallback:** LTE backup, outsource support

**3. Partner/Regulatory**
- **Risk:** Unjani withdrawal, compliance
- **Mitigation:** 24-month contracts, ICASA compliant
- **Fallback:** Direct to community model

### Anticipated Questions

**CEO:** *"Why will we succeed?"*
- First-mover advantage + proven model + right partnerships

**COO:** *"Can we execute?"*
- Standardised deployment + existing expertise + phased scale

**Legal:** *"What's our exposure?"*
- Max loss R72.5K Phase 1, contracts have exit clauses

**SHERQ:** *"Safety and compliance?"*
- 6m poles (no height issues), no trenching, ICASA/municipal permits
