## 4. OBJECTION HANDLING PLAYBOOK

### 4.1 Price Objections

**"It's more expensive than our current solution"**
- **Response:** "Let's look at total cost. How much revenue do you lose when your internet is down? Our 99.9% uptime guarantee means you'll have 8 hours less downtime per year. For most businesses, that pays for the difference in the first month."
- **Follow-up:** Calculate their downtime cost
- **Proof:** Share uptime statistics

**"We can get consumer fibre for R899"**
- **Response:** "You're right, consumer fibre is cheaper. But when it goes down on a Saturday, will anyone answer? We guarantee 24/7 support with 2-hour response. Plus, you get static IPs, better security, and no throttling during business hours."
- **Follow-up:** Ask about their last outage
- **Proof:** Show SLA comparison

### 4.2 Contract Objections

**"We're locked into a contract"**
- **Response:** "I understand. When does it end? We can start the process now and time the installation perfectly. Plus, we might be able to help with early termination if the savings justify it."
- **Follow-up:** Calculate potential savings
- **Proof:** Migration success stories

**"We don't want a long contract"**
- **Response:** "Perfect - we offer month-to-month options. You can also choose 12 months for free installation, or 24 months for 10% discount. What works best for your planning?"
- **Follow-up:** Explain flexibility benefits
- **Proof:** Contract comparison sheet

### 4.3 Technical Objections

**"Our area doesn't have fibre"**
- **Response:** "Let's check right now - I can do a feasibility check in 30 seconds. Even if fibre isn't available today, we can get you on the build priority list and offer alternatives meanwhile."
- **Follow-up:** Run feasibility check
- **Alternative:** Suggest wireless backup

**"Migration seems complicated"**
- **Response:** "We handle everything. Our team manages the entire migration, including coordinating with your current provider. Most customers experience zero downtime during the switch."
- **Follow-up:** Explain migration process
- **Proof:** Migration checklist

### 4.4 Trust Objections

**"We've never heard of CircleTel"**
- **Response:** "We're the business division of [parent company], focusing exclusively on SMEs. We already serve [number] businesses like yours. Would you like to speak with some of them?"
- **Follow-up:** Share references
- **Proof:** Customer testimonials

**"What if you go out of business?"**
- **Response:** "We use the same infrastructure as major providers - Vumatel, OpenServe, DFA. Even in the unlikely event something happened to us, your physical connection remains. Plus, we're backed by [investors/parent]."
- **Follow-up:** Explain infrastructure model
- **Proof:** Financial stability indicators

## 5. PRICING & NEGOTIATION GUIDE

### 5.1 Pricing Strategy

**Standard Pricing Power:**
- List price: 0% discount
- 12-month contract: Free installation (R2,500-8,500 value)
- 24-month contract: 10% monthly discount
- 36-month contract: 15% monthly discount

**Volume Discounts (Multi-site):**
- 2-4 sites: 5% additional
- 5-9 sites: 10% additional
- 10+ sites: 15% additional

**Approval Matrix:**

| Discount | Approval Required | Justification Needed |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| 0-10% | Sales Rep | Standard terms |
| 11-20% | Sales Manager | Competition/volume |
| 21-30% | Head of Sales | Strategic account |
| >30% | CEO | Exceptional case |

### 5.2 Negotiation Tactics

**The Assumptive Close:**
"Based on what you've told me, the Professional package at R2,499 will solve your reliability issues. Should we schedule installation for next Tuesday or Thursday?"

**The Urgency Close:**
"We have an installation slot available this week. If we sign today, you could be operational by Friday. Otherwise, the next slot is in two weeks."

**The Value Stack:**
"So you're getting R2,499 worth of connectivity, R500 worth of static IPs, R300 worth of security features, and R200 worth of priority support - that's R3,499 of value for R2,499."

### 5.3 Upselling Opportunities

**During Sale:**
- Backup connectivity (+R899/month)
- Enhanced security (+R499/month)
- Managed Wi-Fi (+R299/AP/month)

## 7. SALES TOOLS & RESOURCES

### 7.1 ROI Calculator

**Downtime Cost Calculator:**
```
Employees affected: [X]
Average hourly rate: R[Y]
Hours of downtime/month: [Z]
Monthly downtime cost = X � Y � Z

Example:
25 employees � R200/hour � 4 hours = R20,000/month
```

**Productivity Calculator:**
```
Time saved per employee/day: [X minutes]
Employees: [Y]
Working days: 22
Hourly rate: R[Z]

Monthly productivity gain = (X/60) � Y � 22 � Z
