## 14. Frequently Asked Questions (Competitive Positioning)

### "Why are you cheaper than [Competitor X]?"

**Answer:** "We've built our business on the same premium DFA infrastructure they use, but we've optimized our operations to pass savings to customers. We include features like static IPs and routers that others charge extra for, making our total cost of ownership even lower."

### "How can you offer business-grade service at these prices?"

**Answer:** "By focusing exclusively on the SMB market (10-100 employees) and leveraging shared infrastructure efficiently. We're not trying to serve everyone - we're specialists in business broadband for growing companies."

### "What's the catch?"

**Answer:** "No catch. We require a 24-month commitment, which allows us to amortize installation costs and offer lower monthly pricing. You can compare our contract terms with any competitor - they're standard for the industry."

### "Are you better than Vox/MetroFibre/BitCo?"

**Answer:** "We offer the same quality backbone (DFA infrastructure) but at SMB-friendly pricing. If you need uncontended 1:1 enterprise service with 99.9% SLAs, those providers are excellent - but you'll pay 50-100% more. Most SMBs don't need that level, and our 1:10 contention with included static IP is perfect for businesses with 10-100 employees."
