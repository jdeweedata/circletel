# Supersonic (MTN) API Discovery - AgilityGIS Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Site**: https://supersonic.co.za
**Owner**: MTN (Supersonic is MTN's ISP brand)
**Purpose**: Understand how Supersonic/MTN implements coverage checking and package recommendations

1. ‚úÖ **API is UN-AUTHENTICATED** - No API keys or tokens required
2. ‚úÖ **Uses Third-Party Service** - AgilityGIS, not MTN's internal APIs
3. ‚úÖ **Shows 6 5G Packages Available** at Johannesburg CBD (contradicts MTN Business/Fibre results)
4. ‚úÖ **Simple Two-Step Process**: Create lead ‚Üí Get available packages
5. ‚úÖ **Coverage Result**: "You're covered!" message for JHB CBD

2. No authentication tokens or bearer tokens
3. No CORS restrictions observed
4. Endpoints publicly accessible

**Implications**:
- ‚úÖ Easy to integrate - no API key signup required
- ‚úÖ Can be called directly from our frontend
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limiting may apply (not observed during testing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No SLA guarantees without authentication

---

## Integration Recommendations

### Option 1: Use AgilityGIS API Directly (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Pros**:
- No authentication required
- Simple two-step process
- Proven to work (used by MTN's Supersonic)

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Third-party dependency (not MTN's official API)
- ‚ùå No API documentation
- ‚ùå No support agreement
- ‚ùå Could break without notice
- ‚ùå Ethical concerns - using another ISP's service
- ‚ùå Supersonic is a competitor

**Verdict**: **DO NOT USE** - This is Supersonic's (competitor) infrastructure

---

### Option 2: Investigate AgilityGIS as Service Provider

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Proven coverage aggregation platform
- ‚úÖ Supports multiple ISPs/providers
- ‚úÖ Lead management built-in
- ‚úÖ May have official API access

**Cons**:
- ‚ùì Unknown pricing
- ‚ùì Setup/onboarding requirements
- ‚ùì Coverage data sources unclear

**Verdict**: **WORTH INVESTIGATING** - Contact AgilityGIS for official partnership/API access

---

### Option 3: Build Our Own Multi-Provider Aggregation

**Current State**: We already have multi-provider aggregation framework

**Enhancement Needed**:
1. Improve MTN coverage checking (currently showing false positives)
2. Add Supersonic as separate provider option
3. Integrate additional fibre providers (Vumatel, Openserve, Frogfoot, etc.)
4. Build recommendation engine similar to AgilityGIS

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Full control over data sources
- ‚úÖ No dependency on competitors
- ‚úÖ Can customize for CircleTel brand

**Cons**:
- ‚è≥ Development time required
- üí∞ Maintenance costs
- üîß Need to maintain provider integrations

**Verdict**: **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

---

## Key Insights

### 1. MTN Has Multiple Coverage Systems

**Observed MTN/Supersonic Coverage Systems**:
1. **MTN Business Portal** - Wholesale/B2B feasibility tool (TES)
2. **MTN Consumer Site** - Feasibility API + GigZone API + WMS
3. **MTN Fibre Site** - Fibre-specific coverage checker
4. **Supersonic (MTN ISP)** - AgilityGIS third-party aggregator

**Implication**: Different MTN platforms use different APIs with different results!

---

### 2. Third-Party Aggregators Are Common

**Evidence**: MTN's own ISP brand (Supersonic) uses third-party coverage aggregation (AgilityGIS)

**Implication**: It's acceptable and common practice to use aggregation services rather than direct provider APIs

---

### 3. Coverage Discrepancies Across Platforms

**Johannesburg CBD Results**:
- Supersonic: **6 packages** (5G)
- MTN Consumer: **5+ services** (various)
- MTN Fibre: **0 packages** (no fibre)
- MTN Business: **0 packages** (Fixed Wireless infeasible)

**Implication**: Coverage varies significantly depending on:
- Product type (consumer vs business)
- Service type (5G vs fibre vs wireless)
- API/platform used (consumer vs wholesale)

---

### 4. AgilityGIS Capabilities

Based on observed functionality:
- ‚úÖ Lead management system
- ‚úÖ Coverage aggregation across multiple providers
- ‚úÖ Package recommendation engine
- ‚úÖ Organisation branding/white-labeling
- ‚úÖ Integration with multiple ISPs

**Potential Use Case**: CircleTel could partner with AgilityGIS for comprehensive coverage checking across all providers

---

## Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE - Documentation Only

1. ‚úÖ Document AgilityGIS API discovery
2. ‚úÖ Update MTN validation comparison with Supersonic results
3. ‚úÖ Create comprehensive six-way comparison table

### SHORT TERM - Investigation

1. ‚è≥ Research AgilityGIS company and services
2. ‚è≥ Contact AgilityGIS for official API access/partnership
3. ‚è≥ Investigate other ISPs using AgilityGIS
4. ‚è≥ Evaluate cost vs benefit of AgilityGIS partnership

### LONG TERM - Implementation

1. ‚è≥ Decide: AgilityGIS partnership vs build our own aggregation
2. ‚è≥ If building own: Enhance our multi-provider aggregation system
3. ‚è≥ Fix MTN coverage false positives (PostGIS fallback issue)
4. ‚è≥ Add additional fibre providers (Vumatel, Openserve, etc.)

## Screenshot Evidence

**Filename**: `.playwright-mcp/coverage/supersonic-5g-packages-joburg-cbd.png`

**Shows**:
- "You're covered!" success message
- 6 5G packages available
- Pricing from R279 to R749 per month

## Ethical Considerations

### Using Supersonic's API

**Concerns**:
1. ‚ùå Supersonic is a competitor ISP
2. ‚ùå Using their infrastructure without permission
3. ‚ùå No API terms of service accepted
4. ‚ùå Could be considered scraping/unauthorized use

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT** use Supersonic's AgilityGIS endpoints directly

### Investigating AgilityGIS

**Acceptable Use**:
1. ‚úÖ Research AgilityGIS as potential service provider
2. ‚úÖ Contact AgilityGIS for official partnership
3. ‚úÖ Evaluate AgilityGIS for CircleTel's own coverage checking
4. ‚úÖ Learn from their architecture/approach

**Recommendation**: **CONTACT AGILITYGIS** for official API access

## Comparison: Our Project vs Supersonic

| Aspect | Our CircleTel Project | Supersonic (MTN) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Coverage API** | MTN WMS + PostGIS fallback | AgilityGIS third-party |
| **Authentication** | Not required (WMS public) | Not required (AgilityGIS public) |
| **Data Source** | Suspected PostGIS cache | AgilityGIS aggregation |
| **JHB CBD Result** | 4/4 services (FALSE POSITIVE) | 6 5G packages (ACCURATE) |
| **Fibre Shown** | ‚úÖ YES (incorrect) | ‚ùå NO (correct - no MTN fibre at JHB CBD) |
| **5G Shown** | ‚úÖ YES (correct) | ‚úÖ YES (correct) |
| **Provider** | MTN only | Multi-provider via AgilityGIS |

**Key Difference**: Supersonic uses third-party aggregation (AgilityGIS) which provides accurate, provider-agnostic coverage data

---

## Conclusion

### Main Takeaway

**MTN's own ISP brand (Supersonic) doesn't use MTN's direct APIs** - they use a third-party aggregation service (AgilityGIS).

This validates our approach of using third-party services for coverage checking, but we need to:

1. ‚úÖ **Fix our PostGIS fallback** - Currently showing false positives
2. ‚úÖ **Investigate AgilityGIS partnership** - Proven solution used by MTN
3. ‚úÖ **Build comprehensive aggregation** - Similar to AgilityGIS but CircleTel-branded
4. ‚ùå **Do NOT use Supersonic's endpoints** - Competitor infrastructure, unethical

### Recommended Action

**Contact AgilityGIS** to explore:
- Official API access
- Partnership/white-label options
- Pricing and support agreements
- Coverage data sources and accuracy

**AgilityGIS Contact**:
- Website: https://agilitygis.com
- Observed domains: `*.agilitygis.com`, `*-integration.agilitygis.com`
