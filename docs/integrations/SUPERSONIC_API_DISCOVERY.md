## Key Insights

### 1. MTN Has Multiple Coverage Systems

**Observed MTN/Supersonic Coverage Systems**:
1. **MTN Business Portal** - Wholesale/B2B feasibility tool (TES)
2. **MTN Consumer Site** - Feasibility API + GigZone API + WMS
3. **MTN Fibre Site** - Fibre-specific coverage checker
4. **Supersonic (MTN ISP)** - AgilityGIS third-party aggregator

**Implication**: Different MTN platforms use different APIs with different results!

---

### 2. Third-Party Aggregators Are Common

**Evidence**: MTN's own ISP brand (Supersonic) uses third-party coverage aggregation (AgilityGIS)

**Implication**: It's acceptable and common practice to use aggregation services rather than direct provider APIs

---

### 3. Coverage Discrepancies Across Platforms

**Johannesburg CBD Results**:
- Supersonic: **6 packages** (5G)
- MTN Consumer: **5+ services** (various)
- MTN Fibre: **0 packages** (no fibre)
- MTN Business: **0 packages** (Fixed Wireless infeasible)

**Implication**: Coverage varies significantly depending on:
- Product type (consumer vs business)
- Service type (5G vs fibre vs wireless)
- API/platform used (consumer vs wholesale)

---

### 4. AgilityGIS Capabilities

Based on observed functionality:
- ✅ Lead management system
- ✅ Coverage aggregation across multiple providers
- ✅ Package recommendation engine
- ✅ Organisation branding/white-labeling
- ✅ Integration with multiple ISPs

**Potential Use Case**: CircleTel could partner with AgilityGIS for comprehensive coverage checking across all providers

---

## Comparison: Our Project vs Supersonic

| Aspect | Our CircleTel Project | Supersonic (MTN) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Coverage API** | MTN WMS + PostGIS fallback | AgilityGIS third-party |
| **Authentication** | Not required (WMS public) | Not required (AgilityGIS public) |
| **Data Source** | Suspected PostGIS cache | AgilityGIS aggregation |
| **JHB CBD Result** | 4/4 services (FALSE POSITIVE) | 6 5G packages (ACCURATE) |
| **Fibre Shown** | ✅ YES (incorrect) | ❌ NO (correct - no MTN fibre at JHB CBD) |
| **5G Shown** | ✅ YES (correct) | ✅ YES (correct) |
| **Provider** | MTN only | Multi-provider via AgilityGIS |

**Key Difference**: Supersonic uses third-party aggregation (AgilityGIS) which provides accurate, provider-agnostic coverage data

---

## Conclusion

### Main Takeaway

**MTN's own ISP brand (Supersonic) doesn't use MTN's direct APIs** - they use a third-party aggregation service (AgilityGIS).

This validates our approach of using third-party services for coverage checking, but we need to:

1. ✅ **Fix our PostGIS fallback** - Currently showing false positives
2. ✅ **Investigate AgilityGIS partnership** - Proven solution used by MTN
3. ✅ **Build comprehensive aggregation** - Similar to AgilityGIS but CircleTel-branded
4. ❌ **Do NOT use Supersonic's endpoints** - Competitor infrastructure, unethical

### Recommended Action

**Contact AgilityGIS** to explore:
- Official API access
- Partnership/white-label options
- Pricing and support agreements
- Coverage data sources and accuracy
