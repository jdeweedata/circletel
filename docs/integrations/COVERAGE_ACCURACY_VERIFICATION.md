# Coverage Accuracy & Confidence Verification Guide

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Purpose**: Understand API accuracy, confidence scores, and orchestration layer diagnostics  
**Status**: Updated with enhanced metadata tracking

---

## Overview

The coverage orchestration system now tracks detailed confidence metrics and layer diagnostics to help verify result accuracy and understand which data source was used.

---

## Understanding the Metadata

### 1. **Coverage Source**
Indicates which layer in the fallback chain provided the results:

```
"coverage_source": "mtn"  // or "providers", "postgis", "areas", "none"
```

| Source | Meaning | Confidence | Reliability |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **providers** | Supersonic API / Provider Router | 90-95% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **mtn** | MTN Consumer API (fallback) | 80-95% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **postgis** | PostGIS database query | 70% | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **areas** | Legacy coverage areas lookup | 60% | ⭐⭐ |
| **none** | No coverage found | 0% | ❌ |

---

## 2. **Layer Attempts Details**

Each layer attempt now includes:

```json
"layer_attempts": {
  "providers": {
    "success": false,
    "packages_count": 0,
    "confidence": 0,
    "error_reason": "Error message if failed",
    "response_time_ms": 145
  },
  "mtn": {
    "success": true,
    "packages_count": 4,
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "response_time_ms": 200
  }
}
```

### What Each Field Means

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `success` | Did this layer return valid results? |
| `packages_count` | Number of services/packages found |
| `confidence` | Accuracy/trustworthiness score (0-1) |
| `error_reason` | Why it failed (if success=false) |
| `response_time_ms` | How long the API call took |

---

## 3. **Confidence Score Breakdown**

### Provider Router (Layer 1) - Confidence: 0.90-0.95
✅ **Best source**
- Real-time API data from Supersonic (MTN-backed)
- Direct coverage from provider APIs
- Includes pricing and availability verification
- Most accurate for contemporary data

**When to trust**: Always - this is the primary source

### MTN Consumer API (Layer 2) - Confidence: 0.80-0.95
✅ **Good source**
- MTN's own coverage determination
- Infrastructure-validated data
- Based on network topology

**When to trust**: When Provider Router returns no results or fails

### PostGIS Database (Layer 3) - Confidence: 0.70
⚠️ **Acceptable source**
- Geographic database lookups
- Area-based coverage estimates
- May be outdated

**When to trust**: When Layers 1-2 fail, but verify with latest infrastructure data

### Coverage Areas Legacy (Layer 4) - Confidence: 0.60
⚠️ **Last resort**
- Manual address matching
- Oldest data source
- Least accurate

**When to trust**: Only when no other layers have data

---

## 4. **Verification Notes**

The API now returns structured verification information:

```json
"metadata": {
  "confidence_score": 0.85,
  "verification_notes": [
    "Data from MTN Consumer API (fallback layer 2)",
    "Confidence: 85%",
    "Note: Layer 1 (Provider Router) failed or returned no results",
    "Services detected: fibre, fixed_lte, uncapped_wireless, licensed_wireless",
    "Packages available: 8"
  ]
}
```

### How to Interpret Notes

1. **Data Source Explanation**: Which layer provided the data
2. **Confidence %**: Human-readable confidence score
3. **Why Previous Layers Failed**: Explanation of fallback reason
4. **Services Detected**: List of available connectivity types
5. **Package Count**: Total packages available

---

## Example: Interpreting Your Test Results

### Original Response
```json
{
  "source": "mtn",
  "packages": [...8 packages...],
  "available_services": ["fibre", "fixed_lte", "uncapped_wireless", "licensed_wireless"],
  "metadata": {
    "coverage_source": "mtn",
    "confidence_score": 0.85,
    "layer_attempts": {
      "providers": {
        "success": false,
        "packages_count": 0
      },
      "mtn": {
        "success": true,
        "packages_count": 4
      }
    },
    "verification_notes": [
      "Data from MTN Consumer API (fallback layer 2)",
      "Confidence: 85%",
      "Note: Layer 1 (Provider Router) failed or returned no results",
      "Services detected: fibre, fixed_lte, uncapped_wireless, licensed_wireless",
      "Packages available: 8"
    ]
  }
}
```

### What This Tells You

✅ **Coverage is accurate** (85% confidence)
- **Source**: MTN Consumer API
- **Why MTN?**: Layer 1 (Supersonic Provider Router) had 0 packages - likely no data
- **Services**: 4 services available (Fibre, Fixed LTE, Wireless, Licensed Wireless)
- **Packages**: 8 total packages from the service_packages database
- **Reliability**: Good (⭐⭐⭐⭐) - MTN data is well-validated

## How to Check Accuracy in Production

### Step 1: Check the Confidence Score
```
confidence_score >= 0.90 → Very High Confidence (Use as-is)
confidence_score >= 0.80 → High Confidence (Use with notes)
confidence_score >= 0.70 → Medium Confidence (Cross-reference)
confidence_score < 0.70  → Low Confidence (Verify manually)
```

### Step 2: Read the Verification Notes
Notes explain:
- Which layer provided data
- Why previous layers failed
- What services are available
- Total package count

### Step 3: Validate Against Provider Specs
For your test location (Centurion):
- **Expected**: Mix of wireless (5G) and fibre
- **Actual**: 3 SkyFibre (5G) + 5 HomeFibreConnect (Fibre) ✅ Matches expectations

### Step 4: Check Response Times
- Layer 1-4 all have response_time_ms tracked
- Typical times:
  - Providers: < 500ms
  - MTN: 150-300ms
  - PostGIS: 100-200ms
  - Areas: 50-150ms

### Evidence for Centurion Address

| Factor | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Coordinates Valid** | ✅ | `-25.9087, 28.1780` within SA bounds |
| **Services Match Location** | ✅ | Centurion = suburban 5G + emerging fibre |
| **Package Diversity** | ✅ | Both wireless (SkyFibre) and fibre (HomeFibreConnect) |
| **Pricing Realistic** | ✅ | R379-R1099/month aligns with market |
| **Confidence High** | ✅ | 85% confidence from MTN data |
| **API Response Complete** | ✅ | 8 packages, 4 services, metadata included |

---

## Implementing Accuracy Checks in Your Code

### Frontend Example
```javascript
// Check confidence before displaying
if (response.metadata.confidence_score >= 0.80) {
  displayPackages(response.packages);
} else if (response.metadata.confidence_score >= 0.70) {
  displayPackagesWithWarning(response.packages, "Coverage may not be 100% accurate");
} else {
  showManualVerificationOption();
}

// Show verification details
console.log(response.metadata.verification_notes);
// Output: ["Data from MTN Consumer API...", "Confidence: 85%", ...]
```

### Monitoring Example
```javascript
// Log layer performance for monitoring
const layerAttempts = response.metadata.layer_attempts;
Object.entries(layerAttempts).forEach(([layer, data]) => {
  if (data.success) {
    console.log(`${layer}: SUCCESS (${data.response_time_ms}ms)`);
  } else {
    console.log(`${layer}: FAILED - ${data.error_reason}`);
  }
});
```
