## üéØ Executive Summary

Comprehensive testing of the Supersonic AgilityGIS API across 5 major South African locations reveals **location-specific technology recommendations** based on actual infrastructure availability. The API intelligently returns either **5G wireless packages** or **Fibre packages** depending on what infrastructure is best suited for each location.

### Key Findings

1. **5G Coverage**: Centurion, Durban, and Pretoria receive 5G package recommendations
2. **Fibre Coverage**: Cape Town CBD and Johannesburg CBD receive Fibre package recommendations
3. **Package Consistency**: 5G locations get 6 identical packages (R279-R749), Fibre locations get 11 identical packages (R259-R1009)
4. **Infrastructure-Based**: API recommends technology based on actual network infrastructure, not arbitrary rules

## üí° Key Insights for CircleTel Integration

### 1. Infrastructure-Based Recommendations
The API doesn't offer all packages everywhere - it intelligently recommends **only what's actually available** at each location. This is superior to showing all packages and filtering later.

### 2. Technology Prioritization Logic
**Fibre First in CBDs**: Major business districts get fibre (higher density, existing infrastructure)
**5G in Suburban/Mixed**: Areas without extensive fibre get 5G (faster deployment, wireless)

### 3. Pricing Strategy
**5G**: Consistent pricing across all locations (R279-R749)
**Fibre**: Promotional pricing for first 3 months to incentivize sign-ups

### 4. Package Consistency
Within each technology type, packages are **identical across all locations**:
- 5G areas: Always 6 packages with same pricing
- Fibre areas: Always 11 packages with same pricing

This simplifies inventory management and customer expectations.

## üîß Implementation Recommendations for CircleTel

### 1. Adopt Similar Technology Detection
Implement coordinate-based infrastructure detection to show only available technologies:
```typescript
async function detectAvailableTechnologies(lat: number, lng: number) {
  // Check infrastructure databases
  const hasFibre = await checkFibreInfrastructure(lat, lng);
  const has5G = await check5GCoverage(lat, lng);

  // Prioritize like Supersonic
  if (hasFibre && inCBD(lat, lng)) {
    return ['fibre'];
  } else if (has5G) {
    return ['5g', 'lte'];
  }

  return ['lte', 'airfibre']; // Fallback options
}
```

### 2. Location-Specific Package Filtering
Don't show packages that aren't available at the user's location:
```typescript
const availableTech = await detectAvailableTechnologies(lat, lng);
const packages = await getPackages({
  technologies: availableTech,
  location: { lat, lng }
});
```

### 3. Promotional Pricing Strategy
Consider 3-month promotional pricing for fibre packages in competitive areas:
- Attracts customers with lower entry point
- Gives time to experience quality before price increase
- Creates urgency ("limited time offer")

### 4. Package Standardization
Maintain consistent package tiers within each technology:
- **5G**: 4 capped + 2 uncapped (matches Supersonic)
- **Fibre**: 10-12 speed tiers (competitive with Supersonic)
- **AirFibre**: 3-4 tiers (CircleTel specialty)
