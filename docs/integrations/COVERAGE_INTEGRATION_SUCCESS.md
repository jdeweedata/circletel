## 🔍 Technical Foundation

### Based on Test-Fish-Eagle Analysis

From comprehensive analysis of MTN's coverage system:

#### MTN Coverage Architecture
- **WMS Protocol:** OGC Web Map Service 1.3.0
- **Endpoint:** `https://mtnsi.mtn.co.za/cache/geoserver/wms`
- **Method:** GetFeatureInfo (pixel-based lookups)
- **Projection:** EPSG:900913 (Spherical Mercator)

#### Coverage Quality Findings
- 🔴 **Fixed LTE:** Most extensive (100% coverage)
- 🟦 **Uncapped Wireless:** Strong (90%+ coverage)
- 🔵 **Licensed Wireless:** Good (80%+ with gaps)
- 🟢 **Fibre:** Limited (patchy infrastructure)

#### Implementation Accuracy
Our viewport calculator **exactly matches** MTN's implementation:
```javascript
// From test-fish-eagle analysis (MTN's code):
const scale = Math.pow(2, zoom);
const pixelX = Math.floor((worldCoordinate.x - worldCoordinateNW.x) * scale);
const pixelY = Math.floor((worldCoordinate.y - worldCoordinateNW.y) * scale);

// Our implementation (viewport-calculator.ts):
const scale = Math.pow(2, viewport.zoom);
const pixelX = Math.floor((worldPoint.x - worldNW.x) * scale);
const pixelY = Math.floor((worldPoint.y - worldNW.y) * scale);
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Coverage Check Flow

```
1. User enters address
   ↓
2. Address geocoded to lat/lng
   ↓
3. Coordinates validated for SA
   ↓
4. Viewport calculated for WMS
   ↓
5. Pixel coordinates computed
   ↓
6. WMS GetFeatureInfo request
   ↓
7. Coverage results parsed
   ↓
8. Coverage quality analyzed
   ↓
9. Products matched to coverage
   ↓
10. Recommendations scored
   ↓
11. Display available packages
```

### Product Matching Logic

```typescript
Score = Coverage Quality (40)
      + Technology Preference (30)
      + Signal Strength (20)
      + Speed Potential (10)

Priority Order (from test data):
1. Fixed LTE (most extensive)
2. 5G (high speed)
3. LTE (good coverage)
4. Fibre (limited infrastructure)
```
